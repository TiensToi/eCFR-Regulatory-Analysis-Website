Also, as an alternative, in those cases where the application and premium payment are mailed by certified mail within four (4) calendar days from the date of application, the waiting period will be calculated from the date of application even though the application and full amount due are received at the office of the NFIP after ten (10) calendar days following the date of application. Thus, if the application and premium payment are received after ten (10) calendar days from the date of the application or are not mailed by certified mail within four (4) calendar days from the date of application, the waiting period will be calculated from the date of receipt at the office of the NFIP.

          "paragraphs": [
            "(a) General. For purposes of the NFIP, FEMA will only recognize in its flood hazard and risk mapping effort those levee systems that meet, and continue to meet, minimum design, operation, and maintenance standards that are consistent with the level of protection sought through the comprehensive flood plain management criteria established by \u00a7 60.3 of this subchapter. Accordingly, this section describes the types of information FEMA needs to recognize, on NFIP maps, that a levee system provides protection from the base flood. This information must be supplied to FEMA by the community or other party seeking recognition of such a levee system at the time a flood risk study or restudy is conducted, when a map revision under the provisions of part 65 of this subchapter is sought based on a levee system, and upon request by the Federal Insurance Administrator during the review of previously recognized structures. The FEMA review will be for the sole purpose of establishing appropriate risk zone determinations for NFIP maps and shall not constitute a determination by FEMA as to how a structure or system will perform in a flood event.",
            "(b) Design criteria. For levees to be recognized by FEMA, evidence that adequate design and operation and maintenance systems are in place to provide reasonable assurance that protection from the base flood exists must be provided. The following requirements must be met:",
            "(1) Freeboard. (i) Riverine levees must provide a minimum freeboard of three feet above the water-surface level of the base flood. An additional one foot above the minimum is required within 100 feet in either side of structures (such as bridges) riverward of the levee or wherever the flow is constricted. An additional one-half foot above the minimum at the upstream end of the levee, tapering to not less than the minimum at the downstream end of the levee, is also required.",
            "(ii) Occasionally, exceptions to the minimum riverine freeboard requirement described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, may be approved. Appropriate engineering analyses demonstrating adequate protection with a lesser freeboard must be submitted to support a request for such an exception. The material presented must evaluate the uncertainty in the estimated base flood elevation profile and include, but not necessarily be limited to an assessment of statistical confidence limits of the 100-year discharge; changes in stage-discharge relationships; and the sources, potential, and magnitude of debris, sediment, and ice accumulation. It must be also shown that the levee will remain structurally stable during the base flood when such additional loading considerations are imposed. Under no circumstances will freeboard of less than two feet be accepted.",
            "(iii) For coastal levees, the freeboard must be established at one foot above the height of the one percent wave or the maximum wave runup (whichever is greater) associated with the 100-year stillwater surge elevation at the site.",
            "(iv) Occasionally, exceptions to the minimum coastal levee freeboard requirement described in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, may be approved. Appropriate engineering analyses demonstrating adequate protection with a lesser freeboard must be submitted to support a request for such an exception. The material presented must evaluate the uncertainty in the estimated base flood loading conditions. Particular emphasis must be placed on the effects of wave attack and overtopping on the stability of the levee. Under no circumstances, however, will a freeboard of less than two feet above the 100-year stillwater surge elevation be accepted.",
            "(2) Closures. All openings must be provided with closure devices that are structural parts of the system during operation and design according to sound engineering practice.",
            "(3) Embankment protection. Engineering analyses must be submitted that demonstrate that no appreciable erosion of the levee embankment can be expected during the base flood, as a result of either currents or waves, and that anticipated erosion will not result in failure of the levee embankment or foundation directly or indirectly through reduction of the seepage path and subsequent instability. The factors to be addressed in such analyses include, but are not limited to: Expected flow velocities (especially in constricted areas); expected wind and wave action; ice loading; impact of debris; slope protection techniques; duration of flooding at various stages and velocities; embankment and foundation materials; levee alignment, bends, and transitions; and levee side slopes.",
            "(4) Embankment and foundation stability. Engineering analyses that evaluate levee embankment stability must be submitted. The analyses provided shall evaluate expected seepage during loading conditions associated with the base flood and shall demonstrate that seepage into or through the levee foundation and embankment will not jeopardize embankment or foundation stability. An alternative analysis demonstrating that the levee is designed and constructed for stability against loading conditions for Case IV as defined in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE) manual, \u201cDesign and Construction of Levees\u201d (EM 1110-2-1913, Chapter 6, Section II), may be used. The factors that shall be addressed in the analyses include: Depth of flooding, duration of flooding, embankment geometry and length of seepage path at critical locations, embankment and foundation materials, embankment compaction, penetrations, other design factors affecting seepage (such as drainage layers), and other design factors affecting embankment and foundation stability (such as berms).",
            "(5) Settlement. Engineering analyses must be submitted that assess the potential and magnitude of future losses of freeboard as a result of levee settlement and demonstrate that freeboard will be maintained within the minimum standards set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. This analysis must address embankment loads, compressibility of embankment soils, compressibility of foundation soils, age of the levee system, and construction compaction methods. In addition, detailed settlement analysis using procedures such as those described in the COE manual, \u201cSoil Mechanics Design\u2014Settlement Analysis\u201d (EM 1100-2-1904) must be submitted.",
            "(6) Interior drainage. An analysis must be submitted that identifies the source(s) of such flooding, the extent of the flooded area, and, if the average depth is greater than one foot, the water-surface elevation(s) of the base flood. This analysis must be based on the joint probability of interior and exterior flooding and the capacity of facilities (such as drainage lines and pumps) for evacuating interior floodwaters.",
            "(7) Other design criteria. In unique situations, such as those where the levee system has relatively high vulnerability, FEMA may require that other design criteria and analyses be submitted to show that the levees provide adequate protection. In such situations, sound engineering practice will be the standard on which FEMA will base its determinations. FEMA will also provide the rationale for requiring this additional information.",
            "(c) Operation plans and criteria. For a levee system to be recognized, the operational criteria must be as described below. All closure devices or mechanical systems for internal drainage, whether manual or automatic, must be operated in accordance with an officially adopted operation manual, a copy of which must be provided to FEMA by the operator when levee or drainage system recognition is being sought or when the manual for a previously recognized system is revised in any manner. All operations must be under the jurisdiction of a Federal or State agency, an agency created by Federal or State law, or an agency of a community participating in the NFIP.",
            "(1) Closures. Operation plans for closures must include the following:",
            "(i) Documentation of the flood warning system, under the jurisdiction of Federal, State, or community officials, that will be used to trigger emergency operation activities and demonstration that sufficient flood warning time exists for the completed operation of all closure structures, including necessary sealing, before floodwaters reach the base of the closure.",
            "(ii) A formal plan of operation including specific actions and assignments of responsibility by individual name or title.",
            "(iii) Provisions for periodic operation, at not less than one-year intervals, of the closure structure for testing and training purposes.",
            "(2) Interior drainage systems. Interior drainage systems associated with levee systems usually include storage areas, gravity outlets, pumping stations, or a combination thereof. These drainage systems will be recognized by FEMA on NFIP maps for flood protection purposes only if the following minimum criteria are included in the operation plan:",
            "(i) Documentation of the flood warning system, under the jurisdiction of Federal, State, or community officials, that will be used to trigger emergency operation activities and demonstration that sufficient flood warning time exists to permit activation of mechanized portions of the drainage system.",
            "(ii) A formal plan of operation including specific actions and assignments of responsibility by individual name or title.",
            "(iii) Provision for manual backup for the activation of automatic systems.",
            "(iv) Provisions for periodic inspection of interior drainage systems and periodic operation of any mechanized portions for testing and training purposes. No more than one year shall elapse between either the inspections or the operations.",
            "(3) Other operation plans and criteria. Other operating plans and criteria may be required by FEMA to ensure that adequate protection is provided in specific situations. In such cases, sound emergency management practice will be the standard upon which FEMA determinations will be based.",
            "(d) Maintenance plans and criteria. For levee systems to be recognized as providing protection from the base flood, the maintenance criteria must be as described herein. Levee systems must be maintained in accordance with an officially adopted maintenance plan, and a copy of this plan must be provided to FEMA by the owner of the levee system when recognition is being sought or when the plan for a previously recognized system is revised in any manner. All maintenance activities must be under the jurisdiction of a Federal or State agency, an agency created by Federal or State law, or an agency of a community participating in the NFIP that must assume ultimate responsibility for maintenance. This plan must document the formal procedure that ensures that the stability, height, and overall integrity of the levee and its associated structures and systems are maintained. At a minimum, maintenance plans shall specify the maintenance activities to be performed, the frequency of their performance, and the person by name or title responsible for their performance.",
            "(e) Certification requirements. Data submitted to support that a given levee system complies with the structural requirements set forth in paragraphs (b)(1) through (7) of this section must be certified by a registered professional engineer. Also, certified as-built plans of the levee must be submitted. Certifications are subject to the definition given at \u00a7 65.2 of this subchapter. In lieu of these structural requirements, a Federal agency with responsibility for levee design may certify that the levee has been adequately designed and constructed to provide protection against the base flood."

(1) Each participating State shall have an EOP approved by the Regional Administrator and conforming with the requirements for plan content set forth in this part and in CPG 1-3, and in CPG 1-8 \u201cGuide for the Development of State and Local Emergency Operations Plans\u201d and in CPG 1-8A, \u201cGuide for the Review of State and Local Emergency Operations Plans,\u201d which plan must provide for coordinated actions to be undertaken throughout the State in the event of attack and in the event of other disasters.",
            "(2) Each subgrantee jurisdiction shall have a local EOP which conforms with the requirements for plan content as set forth in CPG 1-3 and CPG 1-8 and CPG 1-8A, and which has been approved by the local chief executive or other authorized official and accepted by the Governor or other authorized State official as being consistent with the State's EOP.",
            "(c) Annual submission. Each State should include in its annual CCA application the amount of EMA funding requested (see \u00a7 302.5(c)). In order to participate for a particular Federal fiscal year, however, each State must also, within 60 days of receipt or notice of a formal allocation made pursuant to the criteria set forth in \u00a7 302.5 and in accordance with procedures and criteria specified in CPG 1-3, submit to the Regional Administrator an approvable annual submission which includes:",
            "(1) A request or amended request for a financial contribution from FEMA in a specified amount for civil defense personnel and administrative expenses; (see \u00a7 302.5 (d) through (h)).",
            "(2) Unless previously submitted for the particular Federal fiscal year, a statement of work for the State and proposed subgrantees or amendments to a statement of work previously submitted under the CCA.",
            "(3) Staffing patterns (including new or revised job descriptions not previously submitted) on forms prescribed by FEMA for the civil defense organizations of the State and proposed subgrantees; and",
            "(4) Any amendments to the State administrative plan required to reflect current status.",
            "(d) Approval of State administrative plan and annual submission. If the State administrative plan and the annual submission are determined to be approvable, the Regional Administrator will so notify the State in writing. The State administrative plan is a one-time submission. Unless amendments are necessary to meet Federal standards prescribed in the regulations in this part or in CPG 1-3 or to reflect changes in the State's administrative structure, procedures, criteria, or activities, or unless a portion were conditionally approved by the Regional Administrator as provided for in paragraph (e) of this section, no approval regarding the State administrative plan will be required for a State which participated for the preceding Federal fiscal year.",
            "(e) Agreement for contribution. Approval pursuant to procedures and criteria described in this part and in CPG 1-3 of an annual submission of a State whose administrative plan is approved and current shall constitute agreement between FEMA and the State as grantee for its participation and that of its subgrantees in this program during the Federal fiscal year covered by the approved annual submission on the basis of the requirements and conditions prescribed in this part, in CPG 1-3, and in other federally promulgated criteria referenced in this part. Refusal or failure to comply with such requirements and conditions may result in the grantor agency cancelling, terminating, or suspending the grant, in whole or in part, and refraining from extending any further assistance to the grantee or subgrantee until satisfactory assurance of future compliance has been received.",
            "(f) Disapproval or conditional approval. If a State's administrative plan or annual submission is disapproved, the Regional Administrator will advise the State in writing, including the reasons for such disapproval and the revisions required for approval. The State shall have 30 days from date of such notification in which to submit its revisions. In the event more time is required in which to place the revisions into effect, the Regional Administrator may conditionally approve the State administrative plan or annual submission subject to the specified conditions to be met within a specified time, as agreed by the State and FEMA.",
            "(g) Appeals. (1) Appeal from a Regional Administrator's disapproval of a State administrative plan or an annual submission or other final action as unjustified under the criteria in CPG 1-3 may be made by letter to the Deputy Administrator for the National Preparedness Directorate, signed by an authorized State official and submitted through the Regional Administrator. Such appeal letter shall be mailed or otherwise transmitted so as to reach the Regional Administrator within 30 days after receipt of the notification of disapproval. Failure to file its appeal on time may result in withdrawal of the State's allocation and the proposed funding being reallocated by the Administrator.",
            "(2) A local jurisdiction that regards the final action on its subgrant made by a State as unjustified under the criteria in CPG 1-3 may submit an appeal through the State to the Regional Administrator. Upon receipt of such an appeal, the RegionalAdministrator shall forward the letter, together with all available pertinent documentation from the Regional Administrator's files and any additional documentation submitted by the local jurisdiction in support of its appeal, to the Deputy Administrator for the National Preparedness Directorate, for review and determination. The appeal shall contain all of the exceptions being taken by the State or local jurisdiction, and no exceptions will be determined piecemeal.",
            "(3) No portion of the appellant State's allocation shall be reallocated by FEMA, and no portion of a local jurisdiction's allocation shall be reallocated by the State, pending determination of its appeal by the Administrator. The State and local jurisdiction (if applicable) will be notified in writing of the Administrator's decision, including a statement of the reasons therefor."

            "(a) The Administrator shall allocate the entire amount of funds available for the purposes of this program from the appropriation for each fiscal year. The allocation made to each State represents the total amount of funds available to pay the Federal share of necessary and essential civil defense personnel and administrative expenses of the State and its participating subdivisions during the fiscal year.",
            "(b) The first calculation for developing the allocation for each State will be a formula distribution in accordance with section 205(d) of the Act, made by applying the following percentages to the total sum of Emergency Management Assistance in the President's budget request to Congress:",
            "(1) Fifty (50) percent will be allocated on the basis of the prior-year State allocations, in fulfilment of the statutory requirement to give due regard to \u201cthe relative state of development of civil defense readiness of the State\u201d (State and local levels).",
            "(2) Thirty-three (33) percent will be allocated on the basis of the ratio of the State's population to the national population (50 States, District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico), in fulfilment of the statutory requirements to give due regard to \u201cpopulation\u201d and to \u201cthe criticality of target and support areas and the areas which may be affected by natural disasters with respect to the development of the total civil defense readiness of the Nation.\u201d",
            "(3) Fifteen (15) percent will be divided equally among the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.",
            "(4) In consonance with the statutory provision allowing the Administrator to prescribe other factors concerning the State allocations, the remaining two (2) percent will be held temporarily in reserve, to be used first to fund the four territories of the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Conditions peculiar to those areas make strict application of the mathematical formula in \u00a7 302.5(b) inequitable. Therefore, the Administrator will consider prior-year allocations, percentage of total United States population, and the factors set out in \u00a7 302.5(e) (1), (2), (4), and (5) in determining their allocations. The remaining balance of the reserve fund will then be used to restore any State which would receive less by formula share than its formula share for the previous fiscal year, provided that the reserve balance is sufficient to do this for all such States. Any remaining balance after this has been done will constitute a supplemental fund from which the Administrator will consider State requests for additional funding and the needs of any interstate civil defense authorities.",
            "(c) For initial planning purposes only, each State will then be informed of the figure by the Regional Administrator. The State will base its initial EMA application upon that figure but may request a smaller amount or with appropriate justification a larger amount.",
            "(d) The amount requested by the State shall not exceed 50 percent of its estimate of necessary and essential State and local personnel and administrative expenses for the fiscal year.",
            "(e) The formula distribution shall be reviewed and evaluated, and adjusted as appropriate, by the Administrator, based on the current situation in each State, the requests of all States, and recommendations by the Regional Administrators. The Administrator will consider the following five factors:",
            "(1) The ability of the State and its subgrantees to effectively expend such an amount for necessary and essential civil defense personnel and administrative purposes. Past performance is a factor in this determination.",
            "(2) Special circumstances existing in the State at the time of allocating which require unusual expenditures for civil defense.",
            "(3) Conditions peculiar to the State which make strict application of mathematical formula inequitable either to that State or other States.",
            "(4) The relative cost of civil defense personnel and administrative services in that State; that is, whether such costs are considerably above or below the national average for similar services and expenses.",
            "(5) Substantial changes in the civil defense readiness of the State not reflected by its recent civil defense expenditures.",
            "(f) In September of each year, based on applications received and recommendations by the Regional Administrators, the Administrator will make a tentative allocation to the States. This will include adjustments for States that have indicated they will not be using the total of the formula distribution amount. States can then revise their earlier plans and applications to more nearly reflect the level of funding expected to become available.",
            "(g) A State may provide to the Regional Administrator a preliminary annual submission in an amount not to exceed its tentative allocation.",
            "(h) By September 30 (or as soon thereafter as feasible), the Administrator will make a formal allocation based on, or subject to, appropriation by Congress and allotment of the funds. This allocation for each State may include any additional amounts from the reserve portion of the EMA funds, and shall be in accordance with the regulations in this part and CPG 1-3.",
            "(i) Upon the appropriation becoming available, and if requested by a State, the Regional Administrator may approve such State's preliminary annual submission (if found to meet all requirements in this part and CPG 1-3) in an appropriate amount which does not exceed the amount of the State's share of the Administrator's formal allocation of the Federal appropriation. An award document obligating Federal funds on the basis of the approved preliminary annual submission may be executed in accordance with the provisions of CPG 1-3.",
            "(j) Based on and within 60 days after notification of its formal allocation, each State must provide to the Regional Administrator a final annual submission which meets all requirements in this part and CPG 1-3. If no changes are necessary, a State and the Regional Administrator may adopt in writing the State's preliminary annual submission as its final annual submission. If no award document was executed based on a State's preliminary annual submission, such document will be executed on the basis of that State's approved final annual submission.",
            "(k) With regard to any State whose award document was executed pursuant to a preliminary annual submission covering only part of its formal allocation, upon approval (by the Regional Administrator) of the final annual submission (including a revised statement of work supporting the additional funding request) the Regional Administrator shall execute an amended award document obligating the balance of such State's formal allocation.",
            "(l) After being advised of its annual formal allocation, if a State fails to submit, within 60 days, an approvable annual submission in the amount of its allocation, the Regional Administrator may reallocate the unused portion to other States in the region in such amounts as in his/her judgment will best assure adequate development of the civil defense capability of the Nation. The exception to this authority is in the event a State, or local jurisdiction, refuses to participate in attack preparedness activities. EMA funds withheld or returned for that reason are to be released to headquarters for reallocation on a national basis. In addition, the Regional Administrator may from time to time reallocate the amounts released by a State from its allocation as no longer being required for utilization in accordance with an approved annual submission and award document.",
            "(m) Immediate notice to the headquarters EMA Program Manager of State reallocations is required in the form of copies of EMA-approved Annual Submission amendment documents, accompanied by copies of assistance award/amendment documents signed by regional and State authorized officials of both the releasing and recipient States.",
            "(n) There is no dollar ceiling on the amount of funds that may be reallocated among States in a region. However, at any time that there are funds surplus to the eligible needs of the States within a region, those funds should be promptly released to headquarters for reallocation to other States with unfunded additional requirements.",
            "(o) On July 1 of each fiscal year, the authority to reallocate EMA funds shall revert to the Administrator. In addition, any excess EMA funds available on that date, or that become available during the remainder of the fiscal year, are to be promptly released to headquarters for reallocation by the Administrator."

When large numbers of new workers move to labor surplus areas, heavy burdens are placed on community facilities, such as schools, hospitals, housing, transportation, and utilities. On the other hand, when unemployment develops in certain areas, unemployment costs increase the total cost to the Government, and plants, tools, and workers' skills remain idle and unable to contribute to our national defense program. Consequently, it is the purpose of Defense Manpower Policy No. 4B to direct attention to the potential of labor surplus areas when awarding appropriate procurement contracts and when locating new plants or facilities."

As the risks of military action increase, nations undertake more extensive preparations over a longer period of time to increase their military power. Such preparations by potential adversaries shape the nature and gravity of the threat as well as its likelihood and timing of occurrence. These measures permit the development of reliable indicators of threat at an early time in the evolution of a crisis. Depending on the nature of the situation or event and the nation involved, these early warning indicators may emanate from the political, socio-economic and/or industrial sectors.",
            "(c) The GMR system enables the nation to approach mobilization planning and actions as part of the deterrent response capability and to use it to reduce the probability of conflict. Alternatively, if deterrence should fail, the GMR system would enable the nation to undertake a series of phased actions intended to increase its ability to meet defense and essential civilian requirements.

During the planning and preparation stage, Federal departments and agencies develop their GMR plans and maintain capability to carry out their mobilization-related responsibilities in accordance with section 201 of Executive Order 12656. General types of problems likely to arise in a crisis situation are identified along with possible methods for dealing with them. Investment programs can be undertaken to overcome identified problems.",

            "(1) Federal departments and agencies may need to gather additional data on selected resources or increase their preparedness activities. Costed Option Packages may need to be updated or new ones prepared for the response option measures in each of the department's and agency's area of responsibility. For example, when it appears likely that increased national resources may be required, resource readiness could be improved through the procurement of essential long lead time items, especially those that can be used even if the situation does not escalate. In general, long lead time preparedness actions would be considered for implementation at this time.",

            "(c) Stage 1, National Emergency/War. During a national emergency or declaration of war, mobilization of all national resources escalates and GMR will be subsumed into the overall mobilization effort. As military requirements increase, the national resources would increasingly be focused on the national security emergency. This would involve diverting non-essential demand for scarce resources from peacetime to defense uses, and converting industry from commercial to military production. Both surge production and expansion of the nation's productive capacity may also be necessary. Supplemental appropriations may be required for most Federal departments and agencies having national security emergency responsibilities."

This section would allow the NRC to issue an operating license for such plants without FEMA-approved State and local government plans.",
            "(2) Section 11 provides for the issuance of temporary licenses for operating a utilization facility at a specific power level to be determined by the Commission, pending final action by the Commission on the application. Also, this section authorizes the NRC to issue temporary operating licenses for these facilities without the completion of the required (NRC) Commission hearing process. A petition for such a temporary license may not be filed until certain actions are completed including the submission of a State, local or utility emergency response plan for the facility.",
            "(d) To carry out these responsibilities, FEMA is engaged in a cooperative effort with State and local governments and other Federal agencies in the development of State and local plans and preparedness to cope with the offsite effects resulting from radiological emergencies at commercial nuclear power facilities. FEMA developed and published the Federal Radiological Emergency Response Plan 50 FR 46542 Nov. 8, 1985, to provide the overall support to State and local governments, for all types of radiological incidents including those occurring at nuclear power plants.",
            "(e) FEMA has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the NRC to which it will furnish assessments, findings and determinations as to whether State and local emergency plans and preparedness are adequate and continue to be capable of implementation (e.g., adequacy and maintenance of procedures, training, resources, staffing levels and qualification and equipment adequacy). These findings and determinations will be used by NRC under its own rules in connection with its licensing and regulatory requirements and FEMA will support its findings in the NRC licensing process and related court proceedings.",

            "This part establishes the methodology for FEMA to assess and collect user fees from Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) licensees of commercial nuclear power plants to recover at least 100 percent of the amounts that we anticipate to obligate for our Radiological Emergency Preparedness (REP) Program as authorized under Title III, Public Law 105-276, 112 Stat. 2461, 2502. Public Law 105-276 established in the Treasury a Radiological Emergency Preparedness Fund, to be available under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2011 et. seq.), and under Executive Order 12657 (3 CFR, 1988 Comp., p. 611), for offsite radiological emergency planning, preparedness, and response. Beginning in fiscal year 1999 and thereafter, the Administrator of FEMA must publish fees to be assessed and collected, applicable to persons subject to FEMA's radiological emergency preparedness regulations. The methodology for assessment and collection of fees must be fair and equitable and must reflect the full amount of costs of providing radiological emergency planning, preparedness, response and associated services. Our assessment of fees include our costs for use of agency resources for classes of regulated persons and our administrative costs to collect the fees. Licensees deposit fees by electronic transfer into the Radiological Emergency Preparedness Fund in the U.S. Treasury as offsetting collections."

            "(a)(1) We assess user fees from licensees using a methodology that includes charges for REP Program services provided by both our personnel and our contractors. Beginning in FY 1995, we established a four-year cycle from FY 1995-1998 with predetermined user fee assessments that were collected each year of the cycle. The following six-year cycle will run from FY 1999 through FY 2004. The fee for each site consists of two distinct components:",
            "(i) A site-specific, biennial exercise-related component to recover the portion of the REP program budget associated only with plume pathway emergency planning zone (EPZ) biennial exercise-related activities. We determine this component by reviewing average biennial exercise-related activities/hours that we use in exercises conducted since the inception of our REP user fee program in 1991. We completed an analysis of REP Program activities/hours used during the FY 1991-1995 cycle at the end of that four-year cycle. We will make adjustments to the site-specific user fees for the next proposed FY 1999-2004 six-year cycle.",

            "(2) We will assess fees only for REP Program services provided by our personnel and by our contractors, and we will not assess fees for those services that other Federal agencies involved in the FRPCC or the RAC's provide.",
            "(b) Determination of site-specific, biennial exercise-related component for our personnel. We will determine an average biennial exercise-related cost for our personnel for each commercial nuclear power plant site in the REP Program. We base this annualized cost (dividing the average biennial exercise-related cost by two) on the average number of hours spent by our personnel in REP exercise-related activities for each site. We will determine the average number of hours using an analysis of site-specific exercise activity spent since the beginning of our user fee program (1991). We determine the actual user fee assessment for this component by multiplying the average number of REP exercise-related hours that we determine and annualize for each site by the average hourly rate in effect for the fiscal year for a REP Program employee. We will revise the hourly rate annually to reflect actual budget and cost of living factors, but the number of annualized, site-specific exercise hours will remain constant for user fee calculations and assessments throughout the six-year cycle. We will continue to track and monitor exercise activity during the six-year cycle, FY 1999-2004. We will make appropriate adjustments to this component to calculate user fee assessments for later six-year cycles.",
            "(c) Determination of site-specific, biennial exercise-related component for FEMA contract personnel. We have determined an average biennial exercise-related cost for REP contractors for each commercial nuclear power plant site in the REP Program. We base this annualized cost (dividing the average biennial exercise-related cost by two) on the average costs of contract personnel in REP site-specific exercise-related activities since the beginning of our user fee program (1991). We will continue to track and monitor activity during the initial six-year cycle, FY 1999-2004, and we will make appropriate adjustments to this component for calculation of user fee assessments during subsequent six-year cycles.",
            "(d) Determination of flat fee component. For each year of the six-year cycle, we recover the remainder of REP Program budgeted funds as a flat fee component. Specifically, we determine the flat fee component by subtracting the total of our personnel and contractor site-specific, biennial exercise-related components, as outlined in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, from the total REP budget for that fiscal year. We then divide the resulting amount equally among the total number of licensed commercial nuclear power plant sites (defined under 354.2) to arrive at each site's flat fee component for that fiscal year.",
            "(e) Discontinuation of charges. When we receive a copy from the NRC of their approved exemption to 10 CFR 50.54(q) requirements stating that offsite radiological emergency planning and preparedness are no longer required at a particular commercial nuclear power plant site, we will discontinue REP Program services at that site. We will no longer assess a user fee for that site from the beginning of the next fiscal year."

The report should include a narrative of the training programs conducted accompanied by rosters for each event, agenda, and a summary financial statement on the status of the Agreement funds. Any course or training activity included in the Scope of Work and not presented as scheduled should be explained in detail as to the reason for cancellation in the quarterly report. The costs allocated to this cancelled activity should be reprogrammed to another training activity approved by the Regional Administrator no later than the last day of the 3rd quarter, or released to the Region. An evaluation of the degree to which objectives were met, the effectiveness of the methodology, and the appropriateness of the resources and references used should also be included in the quarterly report. The report is due in the Regional Office no later than the 15th day of January, April, and July. A final report for the year is due the 15th of October."
