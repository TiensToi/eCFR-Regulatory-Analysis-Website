The chief executive officer, chief finance officer or other appropriate senior official as described in paragraph (g)(3) of this section must consider the daily 30.7 calculation as of the close of business on the previous business day and any other factors that may cause a material change in the futures commission's residual interest since the close of business the previous business day, including known unsecured customer debits or deficits, current day market activity and any other withdrawals made from the 30.7 customer accounts; and",
            "(vi) Any such written notice filed with the Commission must be filed via electronic transmission using a form of user authentication assigned in accordance with procedures established by or approved by the Commission, and otherwise in accordance with instruction issued by or approved by the Commission. Any such electronic submission must clearly indicate the registrant on whose behalf such filing is made and the use of such user authentication in submitting such filing will constitute and become a substitute for the manual signature of the authorized signer. Any written notice filed must be followed up with direct communication to the regional office of Commission which has supervisory authority over the futures commission merchant whereby the Commission acknowledges receipt of the notice.",

Except as otherwise provided in this section, the requirement to correct any error applies regardless of the state of the swap that is the subject of the swap transaction and pricing data, including a swap that has terminated, matured, or otherwise is no longer considered to be an open swap.",
            "(i) Timing requirement for correcting errors. The swap execution facility, designated contract market, or reporting counterparty shall correct any error as soon as technologically practicable after discovery of the error. In all cases, errors shall be corrected within seven business days after discovery. Any error that a reporting counterparty discovers or could have discovered during the verification process required under \u00a7 45.14(b) of this chapter is considered discovered for the purposes of this section as of the moment the reporting counterparty began the verification process during which the error was first discovered or discoverable.",
            "(ii) Notification of failure to timely correct. If the swap execution facility, designated contract market, or reporting counterparty will, for any reason, fail to timely correct an error, the swap execution facility, designated contract market, or reporting counterparty shall notify the Director of the Division of Data, or such other employee or employees of the Commission as the Director may designate. The notification shall be in the form and manner, and according to the instructions, specified by the Director of the Division of Data in concurrence with the Director of the Division of Market Oversight, or such other employee or employees of the Commission as the respective Director may designate. Unless otherwise instructed by the Director of the Division of Data, or such other employee or employees of the Commission as the Director may designate from time to time, the notification shall include an initial assessment of the scope of the error or errors that were discovered, and shall include any initial remediation plan for correcting the error or errors, if an initial remediation plan exists. This notification shall be made within 12 hours of the swap execution facility's, designated contract market's, or reporting counterparty's determination that it will fail to timely correct the error.",
            "(iii) Form and manner for error correction. In order to satisfy the requirements of this section, a swap execution facility, designated contract market, or reporting counterparty shall conform to a swap data repository's policies and procedures created pursuant to \u00a7 49.10 of this chapter for correction of errors.",
            "(2) Non-reporting counterparties. Any non-reporting counterparty that by any means becomes aware of any error in the swap transaction and pricing data for a swap to which it is the non-reporting counterparty, shall notify the reporting counterparty for the swap of the error as soon as technologically practicable after discovery, but not later than three business days following discovery of the error. If the non-reporting counterparty does not know the identity of the reporting counterparty, the non-reporting counterparty shall notify the swap execution facility or designated contract market where the swap was executed of the error as soon as technologically practicable after discovery, but no later than three business days following the discovery. Such notice from the non-reporting counterparty to the swap execution facility, designated contract market, or reporting counterparty constitutes discovery under this section.",
            "(3) Exception. The requirements to correct errors set forth in paragraph (e) of this section only apply to errors in swap transaction and pricing data relating to swaps for which the record retention period under \u00a7 45.2 of this chapter has not expired as of the time the error is discovered. Errors in swap transaction and pricing data relating to swaps for which the record retention periods under \u00a7 45.2 of this chapter have expired at the time that the errors are discovered are not subject to the requirements to correct errors set forth in paragraph (e) of this section.",
            "(4) Error defined\u2014(i) Errors. For the purposes of this part, there is an error when swap transaction and pricing data is not completely and accurately reported. This includes, but is not limited to, the following circumstances:",
            "(A) Any of the swap transaction and pricing data for a swap reported to a swap data repository is incorrect or any of the swap transaction and pricing data that is maintained by a swap data repository differs from any of the relevant swap transaction and pricing data contained in the books and records of a party to the swap.",
            "(B) Any of the swap transaction and pricing data for a swap that is required to be reported to a swap data repository or to be maintained by a swap data repository is not reported to a swap data repository or is not maintained by the swap data repository as required by this part.",
            "(C) None of the swap transaction and pricing data for a swap that is required to be reported to a swap data repository or to be maintained by a swap data repository is reported to a swap data repository or is maintained by a swap data repository.",
            "(D) Any of the swap transaction and pricing data for a swap that is no longer an open swap is maintained by the swap data repository as if the swap is still an open swap.",
            "(ii) Presumption. For the purposes of this section, there is a presumption that an error exists if the swap data or the swap transaction and pricing data that is maintained and disseminated by an SDR for a swap is not complete and accurate. This includes, but is not limited to, the swap data that the SDR makes available to the reporting counterparty for verification under \u00a7 49.11 of this chapter.",
            "(f) Data validation acceptance message. (1) A swap data repository shall validate each swap transaction and pricing data report submitted to the swap data repository and notify the reporting counterparty, swap execution facility, or designated contract market submitting the report whether the report satisfied the data validation procedures of the swap data repository as soon as technologically practicable after accepting the swap transaction and pricing data report. A swap data repository may satisfy the requirements of this paragraph by making available data validation acceptance messages as required by \u00a7 49.10 of this chapter.",
            "(2) If a swap transaction and pricing data report submitted to a swap data repository does not satisfy the data validation procedures of the swap data repository, the reporting counterparty, swap execution facility, or designated contract market required to submit the report has not satisfied its obligation to report swap transaction and pricing data in the manner provided by paragraph (d) of this section. The reporting counterparty, swap execution facility, or designated contract market has not satisfied its obligation until it submits the swap transaction and pricing data report in the manner provided by paragraph (d) of this section, which includes the requirement to satisfy the data validation procedures of the swap data repository.",
            "(g) Fees. Any fee or charge assessed on a reporting counterparty, swap execution facility, or designated contract market by a swap data repository that accepts and publicly disseminates swap transaction and pricing data in real-time for the collection of such data shall be equitable and non-discriminatory. If such swap data repository allows a fee discount based on the volume of data reported to it for public dissemination, then such discount shall be made available to all reporting counterparties, swap execution facilities, and designated contract markets in an equitable and non-discriminatory manner."

            "(a) Application procedures. (1) An applicant, person or entity desiring to be registered as a swap data repository shall file electronically an application for registration on Form SDR provided in appendix A to this part, with the Secretary of the Commission at its headquarters in Washington, DC in a format and in the manner specified by the Secretary of the Commission in accordance with the instructions contained therein.",
            "(2) The application shall include information sufficient to demonstrate compliance with core principles specified in Section 21 of the Act and the regulations thereunder. Form SDR consists of instructions, general questions and a list of Exhibits (documents, information and evidence) required by the Commission in order to determine whether an applicant is able to comply with the core principles. An application will not be considered to be materially complete unless the applicant has submitted, at a minimum, the exhibits as required in Form SDR. If the application is not materially complete, the Commission shall notify the applicant that the application will not be deemed to have been submitted for purposes of the 180-day review procedures.",
            "(3) 180-Day review procedures. The Commission will review the application for registration as a swap data repository within 180 days of the date of the filing of such application. In considering an application for registration as a swap data repository, the staff of the Commission shall include in its review, an applicant's past relevant submissions and compliance history. At or prior to the conclusion of the 180-day period, the Commission will either by order grant registration; extend, by order, the 180-day review period for good cause; or deny the application for registration as a swap data repository. The 180-day review period shall commence once a completed submission on Form SDR is submitted to the Commission. The determination of when such submission on Form SDR is complete shall be at the sole discretion of the Commission. If deemed appropriate, the Commission may grant registration as a swap data repository subject to conditions. If the Commission denies an application for registration as a swap data repository, it shall specify the grounds for such denial. In the event of a denial of registration for a swap data repository, any person so denied shall be afforded an opportunity for a hearing before the Commission.",
            "(4) Standard for approval. The Commission shall grant the registration of a swap data repository if the Commission finds that such swap data repository is appropriately organized, and has the capacity: to ensure the prompt, accurate and reliable performance of its functions as a swap data repository; comply with any applicable provisions of the Act and regulations thereunder; carry out its functions in a manner consistent with the purposes of Section 21 of the Act and the regulations thereunder; and operate in a fair, equitable and consistent manner. The Commission shall deny registration of a swap data repository if it appears that the application is materially incomplete; fails in form or substance to meet the requirements of Section 21 of the Act and part 49; or is amended or supplemented in a manner that is inconsistent with this \u00a7 49.3. The Commission shall notify the applicant seeking registration that the Commission is denying the application setting forth the deficiencies in the application, and/or the manner in which the application fails to meet the requirements of this part.",
            "(5) Amendments. If any information reported on Form SDR or in any amendment thereto is or becomes inaccurate for any reason, whether before or after the application for registration has been granted under this paragraph (a), the swap data repository shall promptly file an amendment on Form SDR updating such information.",
            "(6) Service of process. Each swap data repository shall designate and authorize on Form SDR an agent in the United States, other than a Commission official, who shall accept any notice or service of process, pleadings, or other documents in any action or proceedings brought against the swap data repository to enforce the Act and the regulations thereunder.",
            "(b) Provisional registration. The Commission, upon the request of an applicant, may grant provisional registration of a swap data repository if such applicant is in substantial compliance with the standards set forth in paragraph (a)(4) of this section and is able to demonstrate operational capability, real-time processing, multiple redundancy and robust security controls. Such provisional registration of a swap data repository shall expire on the earlier of: the date that the Commission grants or denies registration of the swap data repository; or the date that the Commission rescinds the temporary registration of the swap data repository. This paragraph (b) shall terminate within such time as determined by the Commission. A provisional registration granted by the Commission does not affect the right of the Commission to grant or deny permanent registration as provided under paragraph (a)(3) of this section.",
            "(c) Withdrawal of application for registration. An applicant for registration may withdraw its application submitted pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section by filing with the Commission such a request. Withdrawal of an application for registration shall not affect any action taken or to be taken by the Commission based upon actions, activities, or events occurring during the time that the application for registration was pending with the Commission, and shall not prejudice the filing of a new application by such applicant.",

An applicant for registration may request confidential treatment for materials submitted in its application as set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 40.8 and 145.9 of this chapter. The applicant shall identify with particularity information in the application that will be subject to a request for confidential treatment."

            "(iv) Refer the matter to the Commission for a decision.",
            "(7) If the initial denial of the request for nonpublic records is reversed, the Office of the General Counsel shall, in writing, advise the requester that the records will be available on or after a specified date. If, on appeal, the denial of access to a record is affirmed in whole or in part, the person who requested the information shall be notified in writing of:",

            "(j) Expedited processing. A request may be given expedited processing if the requester demonstrates a compelling need for the requested records. For purposes of this provision, the term \u201ccompelling need\u201d means: That a failure to obtain requested records on an expedited basis could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; or with respect to a request made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information, urgency to inform the public concerning actual or alleged federal government activity. A requester who seeks expedited processing must demonstrate a compelling need by submitting a statement that is certified by the requester to be true and correct to the best of that person's knowledge and belief. The FOIA compliance staff\n\nwill determine whether to provide expedited processing, and notice of the determination will be provided to requester, within ten days after the date of the request. If the request for expedited processing is denied, the requester may file an appeal with the Office of the General Counsel within ten days of the date of the denial by the FOIA compliance staff. The Office of the General Counsel will respond to the appeal within ten days after the date of the appeal."

All records which contain information for which a request for confidential treatment is made or the appropriate segregable portions thereof should be marked by the person submitting the records with a prominent stamp, typed legend, or other suitable form of notice on each page or segregable portion of each page stating \u201cConfidential Treatment Requested by [name].\u201d If such marking is impractical under the circumstances, a cover sheet prominently marked \u201cConfidential Treatment Requested by [name]\u201d should be securely attached to each group of records submitted for which confidential treatment is requested. Each of the records transmitted in this matter should be individually marked with an identifying number and code so that they are separately identifiable. In some circumstances, such as when a person is testifying in the course of a Commission investigation or providing documents requested in the course of a Commission inspection, it may be impractical to submit a written request for confidential treatment at the time the information is first provided to the Commission. In no circumstances can the need to comply with the requirements of this section justify or excuse any delay in submitting information to the Commission. Rather, in such circumstances, the person testifying or otherwise submitting information should inform the Commission employee receiving the information, at the time the information is submitted or as soon thereafter as practicable, that the person is requesting confidential treatment for the information. The person shall then submit a written request for confidential treatment within 30 days of the submission of the information. If access is requested under the Freedom of Information Act with respect to material for which no timely request for confidential treatment has been made, it may be presumed that the submitter of the information has waived any interest in asserting that the material is confidential.",
            "(5) A request for confidential treatment shall state the length of time for which confidential treatment is being sought.",
            "(6) A request for confidential treatment (as distinguishing from the material that is the subject of the request) shall be considered a public document. When a submitter deems it necessary to include, in its request for confidential treatment, information for which it seeks confidential treatment, the submitter shall place that information in an appendix to the request.",
            "(7) On 10 business days notice from the FOIA compliance staff, a submitter shall submit a detailed written justification of a request for confidential treatment, as specified in paragraph (e) of this section. Upon request and for good cause shown, the FOIA compliance staff may grant an extension of such time. The FOIA compliance staff will notify the submitter that failure to provide timely a detailed written justification will be deemed a waiver of the submitter's opportunity to appeal an adverse determination.",
            "(8)(i) Requests for confidential treatment for any reasonably segregable material that is not exempt from public disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, as implemented in \u00a7 145.5, shall be summarily rejected under \u00a7 145.9(d)(9). Requests for confidential treatment of public information contained in financial reports as specified in \u00a7 1.10 shall not be processed. A submitter has the burden of specifying clearly and precisely the material that is the subject of the confidential treatment request. A submitter may be able to meet this burden in various ways, including:",
            "(A) Segregating material for which confidential treatment is being sought;",
            "(B) Submitting two copies of the submission: a copy from which material for which confidential treatment is being sought has been obliterated, deleted, or clearly marked and an unmarked copy; and",
            "(C) Clearly describing the material within a submission for which confidential treatment is being sought.",
            "(ii) A submitter shall not employ a method of specifying the material for which confidential treatment is being sought if that method makes it unduly difficult for the Commission to read the full submission, including all portion claimed to be confidential, in its entirely.",
            "(9) If a submitter fails to follow the procedures set forth in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(8) of this section, the FOIA compliance staff may summarily reject the submitter's request for confidential treatment with leave to the submitter to refile a proper petition. Failure of the FOIA compliance staff summarily to reject a confidential treatment request pursuant to this paragraph shall not be construed to indicate that the submitter has complied with the procedures set forth in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(8) of this section.",
            "(10) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(9) of this section, no determination with respect to any request for confidential treatment will be made until the Commission receives a Freedom of Information Act request for the material for which confidential treatment is being sought.",
            "(e) Detailed written justification of request for confidential treatment. (1) If the FOIA compliance staff determines that a FOIA request seeks material for which confidential treatment has been requested pursuant to \u00a7 145.9, the FOIA compliance staff shall require the submitter to file a detailed written justification of the confidential request within ten business days (unless under \u00a7 145.9(d)(7) an extension of time has been granted) of that determination unless, pursuant to an earlier FOIA request, a prior determination to release or withhold the material has been made, the submitter has already provided sufficient information to grant the request for confidential treatment; or the material is otherwise in the public domain. The detailed written justification shall be filed with the FOIA compliance staff. It shall be clearly marked \u201cDetailed Written Justification of FOIA Confidential Treatment Request\u201d and shall contain the request number supplied by the Commission. The submitter shall also send a copy of the detailed written justification to the FOIA requester at the address specified by the Commission.",
            "(2) The period for filing a detailed written justification may be extended upon request and for good cause shown.",
            "(3) The detailed written justification of the confidential treatment request shall contain:",
            "(i) The reasons, referring to the specific exemptive provisions of the Freedom of Information Act listed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, why the information that is the subject of the FOIA request should be withheld from access under the Freedom of Information Act;",
            "(ii) The applicability of any specific statutory or regulatory provisions that govern or may govern the treatment of the information;",
            "(iii) The existence and applicability of prior determinations by the Commission, other federal agencies, or courts concerning the specific exemptive provisions of the Freedom of Information Act pursuant to which confidential treatment is being requested. Submitters shall satisfy any evidentiary burdens imposed upon them by applicable Freedom of Information Act case law.",
            "(iv) Such additional facts and authorities as the submitter may consider appropriate.",
            "(4) The detailed written justification of a confidential treatment request shall be accompanied by affidavits to the extent necessary to establish the facts necessary to satisfy the submitter's evidentiary burden.",
            "(5) The detailed written justification of a confidential treatment request (as distinguished from the material that is the subject of the request) shall be considered a public document. However, a submitter will be permitted to submit to the Commission supplementary confidential affidavits with his or her detailed written justification if that is the only way in which he or she can convincingly demonstrate that the material that is the subject of the confidential treatment request should not be disclosed to the FOIA requester.",
            "(f) Initial determination with respect to petition for confidential treatment. (1) The FOIA compliance staff, in consultation with the Office in which the record was located, shall issue an initial determination with respect to a confidential treatment request for material that is responsive to the FOIA request. This determination shall be issued at the same time as the initial determination with respect to the FOIA request. See \u00a7 145.7(g). To the extent that the initial determination grants a confidential treatment request in full or in part, it should specify the FOIA exemptions upon which this determination is based and briefly describe the material to which each exemption applies. See \u00a7 145.7(g)(2). To the extent that the initial determination denies confidential treatment to any material for which confidential treatment was requested, it should briefly describe the material for which confidential treatment is denied.",
            "(2) If the FOIA compliance staff determines that a confidential treatment request shall be denied in full or in part, the submitter shall be informed of his or her right to appeal to the Commission's General Counsel in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph (g) of this section. The material for which confidential treatment was denied shall be released to the FOIA requester if the submitter does not file an appeal within 10 business days of the date on which his or her request was denied.",
            "(3) If the FOIA compliance staff determines that a confidential treatment request shall be granted in full or in part, the FOIA requester shall be informed of his or her right to appeal to the Commission's General Counsel in accordance with the procedures set forth in \u00a7 145.7(h).",
            "(g) Appeal from initial determination that confidential treatment is not warranted. (1) An appeal from an initial determination to deny a confidential treatment request in full or in part shall be filed with the General Counsel of the Commission. No disclosure of the material that is the subject of the appeal shall be made until the appeal is resolved. If both a submitter and a FOIA requester appeal to the General Counsel from a partial grant and partial denial of a confidential treatment request, those appeals shall be consolidated.",
            "(2) Any appeal of a denial of a request for confidential treatment shall be in writing, and shall be clearly marked \u201cFOIA Confidential Treatment Appeal.\u201d The appeal shall include a copy of the initial determination and shall clearly indicate the portions of the initial determination from which an appeal is being taken.",
            "(3) The appeal shall be sent to the Commission's Office of the General Counsel. A copy of the appeal shall be sent to the FOIA requester. The General Counsel or his or her designee shall have the authority to consider all appeals from initial determinations of the FOIA compliance staff. The General Counsel may, in his sole and unfettered discretion, refer such appeals and questions concerning stays under paragraph (g)(10) of this section to the Commission for decision.",
            "(4) In the appeal, the submitter may supply additional substantiation for his or her request for confidential treatment, including additional affidavits and additional legal argument. Such submissions shall be governed by paragraph (e)(5) of this section.",
            "(5) The FOIA requester shall have an opportunity to respond in writing to the appeal within 10 business days of the date of filing of the FOIA Confidential Treatment Appeal. The FOIA requester need not respond, however. Any response shall be sent to the Commission's Office of the General Counsel. A copy shall be sent to the submitter.",
            "(6) All FOIA Confidential Treatment Appeals and all responses thereto shall be considered public documents.",
            "(7) The General Counsel will make a determination with respect to any appeal within twenty business days after receipt by the Office of the General Counsel of such appeal or within such extended period as may be permitted in accordance with the standards set forth in \u00a7 145.7(g)(3). Although other procedures may be employed, to the extent possible the General Counsel will decide the appeal on the basis of the affidavits and other documentary evidence submitted by the submitter and the FOIA requests.",
            "(8) The General Counsel or his or her designee shall have the authority to remand any matter to the FOIA compliance staff to correct deficiencies in the initial processing of the confidential treatment request.",
            "(9) If the General Counsel or his or her designee denies a confidential treatment appeal in full or in part, the information for which confidential treatment is denied shall be disclosed to the FOIA requester 10 business days later, subject to any stay entered pursuant to paragraph (g)(10) of this section.",
            "(10) The General Counsel or their designee shall have the authority to enter and vacate stays as set forth below. If, within 10 business days of the date of issuance of a determination by the General Counsel or their designee to disclose information for which a submitter sought confidential treatment, the submitter commences an action in federal court concerning that determination, the General Counsel will stay the public disclosure of the information pending final judicial resolution of the matter. The General Counsel or their designee may vacate a stay entered under this section, either on his or her own motion or at the request of the FOIA requester. If such a stay is vacated, the information will be released to the requester 10 business days after the submitter is notified of this action, unless a court orders otherwise.",
            "(h) Extensions of time limits. Any time limit under this section may be extended for good cause shown, in the discretion of the Commission, the Commission's General Counsel, or the FOIA compliance staff.",
            "(i) A submitter whose confidential treatment request has been upheld by the Commission shall, upon request of the General Counsel, aid the Commission in defending a court action to compel the Commission to disclose the information subject to the confidential treatment request. If the submitter is unwilling to aid the Commission in this regard, the General Counsel may, in appropriate cases, make the information available to the public."

These rules apply to all records maintained by this Commission which are not excepted or exempted as set forth in \u00a7 146.12, insofar as they contain personal information concerning an individual, identify that individual by name or other symbol and are contained in a system of records from which information is retrieved by the individual's name or identifying symbol. Among the primary purposes of these rules are to permit individuals to determine whether information about them is contained in Commission files and, if so, to obtain access to that information; to establish procedures whereby individuals may have inaccurate and incomplete information corrected; and, to restrict access by unauthorized persons to that information.",

            "(9) From section (g) (Civil Remedies), because this system of records is exempt from the individual access and amendment provisions in section (d) of the Privacy Act for the reasons stated in paragraph (e)(3) of this section; therefore, the Commission is not subject to civil action for failure to adhere to those requirements.",
            "(f) CFTC-44 Personnel Clearance System. The system of records identified as CFTC-44 Personnel Clearance System contains records related to the background investigations and security clearances of individuals who have been or are being considered for access to Commission facilities, information technology systems, and classified or confidential information. These records may include statements from individuals who have provided information in the course of a background investigation and have requested that their identity remain confidential. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) and (5) and subject to the requirements and limitations set forth therein, the Commission is exempting this system of records from the following provisions of the Privacy Act: 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3); (d)(1) through (4); (e)(1); (e)(4)(G) through (I); and (f), and from the following corresponding sections of these rules: \u00a7\u00a7 146.3; 146.5; 146.6(d); 146.11(a)(7) through (9); and 146.7(a). Exemptions from these particular sections of the Privacy Act are justified for the following reasons:",
            "(1) From sections (c)(3) (Accounting of Certain Disclosures), because release of the accounting of certain disclosures could alert the subject of an investigation to the extent of that investigation and reveal investigative interests of the Commission and the recipient entity that were previously unknown to the individual. Release of such information to the subject of an investigation could reasonably be anticipated to impede and interfere with the Commission's efforts to adequately assess an individual when making a decision about the individual's access to Commission facilities, information technology systems, and classified and confidential information.",
            "(2) From sections (d)(1) through (4) (Access and Amendment), because the records contained in this system may be related to ongoing investigations, and individual access to these records could alert the subject of an investigation to the extent of that investigation and reveal investigative interests of the Commission and others that were previously unknown to the individual. Providing a subject with access to these records could impair the effectiveness of the Commission's investigations and could significantly impede the investigation by providing the opportunity for the subject to destroy documentary evidence, improperly influence witnesses and confidential sources, fabricate testimony, and engage in other activities that could compromise the investigation. In addition, providing an individual with access to these records may reveal the identity of a source who furnished information under an express promise that their identity would remain confidential. Amendment of the records in this system of records would interfere with ongoing law enforcement proceedings and impose an impossible administrative burden by requiring law enforcement investigations to be continuously reinvestigated.",
            "(3) From section (e)(1) (Relevancy and Necessity of Information), because in the course of conducting and adjudicating background investigations, the significance of certain information may not be clear or the information may not be strictly relevant or necessary to a specific investigation; but, effective investigations require the retention of all information that may aid in the investigation and provide investigative leads.",
            "(4) From sections (e)(4)(G) through (I) (Agency Requirements), and (f) (Agency Rules), because the Commission is not required to establish requirements, rules, or procedures related to access and amendment of records in a system of records that is exempt from the individual access and amendment provisions in section (d) of the Privacy Act.",
            "(g) CFTC-49 Whistleblower Records. The system of records identified as CFTC-49 Whistleblower Records contains records related to whistleblower tips, complaints and referrals, records related to investigations and inquiries into whistleblower complaints, and records related to the whistleblower award claim and determination process. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) and subject to the requirements and limitations set forth therein, the Commission is exempting this system of records from the following provisions of the Privacy Act: 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3); (d)(1) through (4); (e)(1); (e)(4)(G) through (I); and (f), and from the following corresponding sections of these rules: \u00a7\u00a7 146.3; 146.5; 146.6(d); 146.11(a) through (9); and 146.7(a). Exemptions from these particular sections of the Privacy Act are justified for the following reasons:",
            "(1) From section (c)(3) (Accounting of Certain Disclosures), because release of the accounting of certain disclosures could alert the subject of an investigation to the existence and extent of that investigation and reveal the investigative interests of the Commission and the recipient entity. Release of such information to the subject of an investigation could reasonably be anticipated to impede and interfere with the Commission's efforts to identify and investigate unlawful activities.",
            "(2) From sections (d)(1) through (4) (Access and Amendment), because individual access to these records could alert the subject of an investigation to the existence and extent of that investigation and reveal the investigative interests of the Commission and others. Providing a subject with access to these records could impair the effectiveness of the Commission's investigations and could significantly impede the investigation by providing the opportunity for the subject to destroy documentary evidence, improperly influence witnesses and confidential sources, fabricate testimony, and engage in other activities that could compromise the investigation. Allowing the subject of the investigation to amend records in this system of records could likewise interfere with ongoing law enforcement proceedings and impose an impossible administrative burden by requiring law enforcement investigations to be continuously reinvestigated.",
            "(3) From section (e)(1) (Relevancy and Necessity of Information), because in the course of investigations, the significance of certain information may not be clear or the information may not be strictly relevant or necessary to a specific investigation; but, effective investigations require the retention of all information that may aid in the investigation or aid in establishing patterns of activity and provide investigative leads. (4) From sections (e)(4)(G) through (I) (Agency Requirements) and (f) (Agency Rules), because the Commission is not required to establish requirements, rules, or procedures related to access and amendment of records in a system of records that is exempt from the individual access and amendment provisions in section (d) of the Privacy Act."

If the Commission or any of these other authorities makes a request, inquiry, or demand to the whistleblower or the whistleblower's representative first, the whistleblower's submission will not be considered voluntary, and the whistleblower will not be eligible for an award, even if the whistleblower's response is not compelled by subpoena or other applicable law. For purposes of this paragraph (o), the whistleblower will be considered to have received a request, inquiry or demand if documents or information from the whistleblower is within the scope of a request, inquiry, or demand that the whistleblower's employer receives, unless, after receiving the documents or information from the whistleblower, the whistleblower's employer fails to provide the whistleblower's documents or information to the requesting authority in a timely manner.",

A procedure established by a designated contract market under the Act for the settlement of customers' claims or grievances against a member or employee thereof may permit the submission of a counterclaim in the procedure by a person against whom a claim or grievance is brought. The designated contract market may permit such a counterclaim where the counterclaim arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject of the customer's claim or grievance and does not require for adjudication the presence of essential witnesses, parties, or third persons over whom the designated contract market does not have jurisdiction. Other counterclaims arising out of a transaction subject to the Act and rules promulgated thereunder for which the customer utilizes the services of the registrant may be permissible where the customer and the registrant have agreed in advance to require that all such submissions be included in the proceeding, and if the aggregate monetary value of the counterclaims is capable of calculation.",
            "(g) Eligible contract participants. A person who is an \u201celigible contract participant\u201d as defined in section 1a(12) of the Act may negotiate any term of an agreement or understanding with a Commission registrant in which the eligible contract participant agrees, prior to the time a claim or grievance arises, to submit such claim or grievance to any settlement procedure provided for in the agreement."

            "(b) In addition to the Commission's rules of practice set forth in part 201 of this chapter, the Commission has promulgated rules and regulations pursuant to the several statutes it administers (parts 230, 240, 260, 270 and 275 of this chapter). These parts contain substantive provisions and include as well numerous provisions detailing the procedure for meeting specific standards embodied in the statutes. The Commission's rules and regulations under each of the statutes are available in pamphlet form upon request to the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402.",
            "(c) The statutes and the published rules, regulations and forms thereunder prescribe the course and method of formal procedures to be followed in Commission proceedings. These are supplemented where feasible by certain informal procedures designed to aid the public and facilitate the execution of the Commission's functions. There follows a brief description of procedures generally followed by the Commission which have not been formalized in rules.",
            "(d) The informal procedures of the Commission are largely concerned with the rendering of advice and assistance by the Commission's staff to members of the public dealing with the Commission. While opinions expressed by members of the staff do not constitute an official expression of the Commission's views, they represent the views of persons who are continuously working with the provisions of the statute involved. And any statement by the director, associate director, assistant director, chief accountant, chief counsel, or chief financial analyst of a division can be relied upon as representing the views of that division. In certain instances an informal statement of the views of the Commission may be obtained. The staff, upon request or on its own motion, will generally present questions to the Commission which involve matters of substantial importance and where the issues are novel or highly complex, although the granting of a request for an informal statement by the Commission is entirely within its discretion."

Similarly, persons contemplating filings with the Commission may receive advice of a general nature as to the preparation thereof, including information as to the forms to be used and the scope of the items contained in the forms. Inquiries may be directed to an appropriate officer of the Commission's staff.

If the filing appears to afford inadequate disclosure, as for example through omission of material information or through violation of accepted accounting principles and practices, the usual practice is to bring the deficiency to the attention of the person who filed the document by letter from the Assistant Director assigned supervision over the particular filing, and to afford a reasonable opportunity to discuss the matter and make the necessary corrections. This informal procedure is not generally employed when the deficiencies appear to stem from careless disregard of the statutes and rules or a deliberate attempt to conceal or mislead or where the Commission deems formal proceedings necessary in the public interest. If an electronic filing is not prepared in accordance with the requirements of the current EDGAR Filer Manual, the filing may be suspended and the filer so notified. Reasonable opportunity will be afforded the filer to make the necessary corrections or resubmit the filing as needed. Where it appears that the filing affords adequate disclosure, acceleration of its effectiveness when appropriate normally will be granted. A similar procedure is followed with respect to filings under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and certain filings relating to investment companies under the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, which are routed to the Division of Investment Management. A similar procedure is also followed in the Commission's Regional Offices with respect to registration statements on Forms SB-1 and SB-2 (17 CFR 239.9 and 239.10) and related filings under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939.",
            "(b)(1) Applications for registration as brokers, dealers, investment advisers, municipal securities dealers and transfer agents are submitted to the Office of Filings and Information Services where they are examined to determine whether all necessary information has been supplied and whether all required financial statements and other documents have been furnished in proper form. Defective applications may be returned with a request for correction or held until corrected before being accepted as a filing. The files of the Commission and other sources of information are considered to determine whether any person connected with the applicant appears to have engaged in activities which would warrant commencement of proceedings on the question of denial of registration. The staff confers with applicants and makes suggestions in appropriate cases for amendments and supplemental information. Where it appears appropriate in the public interest and where a basis therefore exists, denial proceedings may be instituted. Within 45 days of the date of the filing of a broker-dealer, investment adviser or municipal securities dealer application (or within such longer period as to which the applicant consents), the Commission shall by order grant registration or institute proceedings to determine whether registration should be denied. An application for registration as a transfer agent shall become effective within 30 days after receipt of the application (or within such shorter period as the Commission may determine). The Office of Filings and Information Services is also responsible for the processing and substantive examination of statements of beneficial ownership of securities and changes in such ownership filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the Investment Company Act of 1940, and for the examination of reports filed pursuant to \u00a7 230.144 of this chapter.",
            "(2) Applications for registration as national securities exchanges, or exemption from registration as exchanges by reason of such exchanges' limited volume of transactions filed with the Commission are routed to the Division of Trading and Markets, which examines these applications to determine whether all necessary information has been supplied and whether all required financial statements and other documents have been furnished in proper form. Defective applications may be returned. The files of the Commission and other sources of information are considered to determine whether any person connected with the applicant appears to have engaged in activities which would warrant commencement of proceedings on the question of denial of registration. The staff confers with applicants and makes suggestions in appropriate cases for amendments and supplemental information. Where it appears appropriate in the public interest and where a basis therefore exists, denial proceedings may be instituted. Within 90 days of the date of publication of a notice of the filing of an application for registration as a national securities exchange, or exemption from registration by reason of such exchanges' limited volume of transactions (or within such longer period as to which the applicant consents), the Commission shall by order grant registration, or institute proceedings to determine whether registration should be denied as provided in \u00a7 240.19(a)(1) of this chapter.",

Checks will not be accepted for payment of fees. To ensure proper posting, all filers must include their Commission-assigned Central Index Key (CIK) number (also known as the Commission-assigned registrant or payor account number) on fee payments. If a third party submits a fee payment, the fee payment must specify the account number to which the fee is to be applied.",

In such preliminary investigation no process is issued or testimony compelled. The Commission may, in its discretion, make such formal investigations and authorize the use of process as it deems necessary to determine whether any person has violated, is violating, or is about to violate any provision of the federal securities laws or the rules of a self-regulatory organization of which the person is a member or participant. Unless otherwise ordered by the Commission, the investigation or examination is non-public and the reports thereon are for staff and Commission use only.",

The Commission may also, on some occasions, refer the matter to, or grant requests for access to its files made by, domestic and foreign governmental authorities or foreign securities authorities, self-regulatory organizations such as stock exchanges or the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., and other persons or entities.",

Submissions by interested persons should be forwarded to the appropriate Division Director or Regional Director with a copy to the staff members conducting the investigation and should be clearly referenced to the specific investigation to which they relate. In the event a recommendation for the commencement of an enforcement proceeding is presented by the staff, any submissions by interested persons will be forwarded to the Commission in conjunction with the staff memorandum.",

Accordingly, it hereby announces its policy not to permit a defendant or respondent to consent to a judgment or order that imposes a sanction while denying the allegations in the complaint or order for proceedings. In this regard, the Commission believes that a refusal to admit the allegations is equivalent to a denial, unless the defendant or respondent states that he neither admits nor denies the allegations.",

It is the policy of the Commission, however, that the disposition of any such matter may not, expressly or impliedly, extend to any criminal charges that have been, or may be, brought against any such person or any recommendation with respect thereto. Accordingly, any person involved in an enforcement matter before the Commission who consents, or agrees to consent, to any judgment or order does so solely for the purpose of resolving the claims against him in that investigative, civil, or administrative matter and not for the purpose of resolving any criminal charges that have been, or might be, brought against him. This policy reflects the fact that neither the Commission nor its staff has the authority or responsibility for instituting, conducting, settling, or otherwise disposing of criminal proceedings. That authority and responsibility are vested in the Attorney General and representatives of the Department of Justice."

Rules relating to Commission organization, procedure and management, for example, are generally adopted by the Commission without affording public discussion thereof. On the other hand, in the adoption of substantive rules materially affecting an industry or a segment of the public, such as accounting rules, every feasible effort is made in advance of adoption to receive the views of persons to be affected.

            "Freedom of the press is of vital importance to the mission of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Effective journalism complements the Commission's efforts to ensure that investors receive the full and fair disclosure that the law requires, and that they deserve. Diligent reporting is an essential means of bringing securities law violations to light and ultimately helps to deter illegal conduct. In this Policy Statement the Commission sets forth guidelines for the agency's professional staff to ensure that vigorous enforcement of the federal securities laws is conducted completely consistently with the principles of the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of the press, and specifically to avoid the issuance of subpoenas to members of the media that might impair the news gathering and reporting functions. These guidelines shall be adhered to by all members of the staff in all cases:",
            "(a) In determining whether to issue a subpoena to a member of the news media, the approach in every case must be to strike the proper balance between the public's interest in the free dissemination of ideas and information and the public's interest in effective enforcement of the federal securities laws.",
            "(b) When the staff investigating a matter determines that a member of the news media may have information relevant to the investigation, the staff should:",
            "(1) Determine whether the information might be obtainable from alternative non-media sources.",
            "(2) Make all reasonable efforts to obtain that information from those alternative sources. Whether all reasonable efforts have been made will depend on the particular circumstances of the investigation, including whether there is an immediate need to preserve assets or protect investors from an ongoing fraud.",
            "(3) Determine whether the information is essential to successful completion of the investigation.",
            "(c) If the information cannot reasonably be obtained from alternative sources and the information is essential to the investigation, then the staff, after seeking approval from the responsible Regional Director, District Administrator, or Associate Director, should contact legal counsel for the member of the news media. Staff should contact a member of the news media directly only if the member is not represented by legal counsel. The purpose of this contact is to explore whether the member may have information essential to the investigation, and to determine the interests of the media with respect to the information. If the nature of the investigation permits, the staff should make clear what its needs are as well as its willingness to respond to particular problems of the media. The staff should consult with the Commission's Office of Public Affairs, as appropriate.",
            "(d) The staff should negotiate with news media members or their counsel, consistently with this Policy Statement, to obtain the essential information through informal channels, avoiding the issuance of a subpoena, if the responsible Regional Director, District Administrator, or Associate Director determines that such negotiations would not substantially impair the integrity of the investigation. Depending on the circumstances of the investigation, informal channels may include voluntary production, informal interviews, or written summaries.",
            "(e) If negotiations are not successful in achieving a resolution that accommodates the Commission's interest in the information and the media's interests without issuing a subpoena, the staff investigating the matter should then consider whether to seek the issuance of a subpoena for the information. The following principles should guide the determination of whether a subpoena to a member of the news media should be issued:",
            "(1) There should be reasonable grounds to believe that the information sought is essential to successful completion of the investigation. The subpoena should not be used to obtain peripheral or nonessential information.",

Whether all reasonable efforts have been made to obtain the information from alternative sources will depend on the particular circumstances of the investigation, including whether there is an immediate need to preserve assets or protect investors from an ongoing fraud.",
            "(f) If there are reasonable grounds to believe the information sought is essential to the investigation, all reasonable alternative means of obtaining it have been exhausted, and all efforts at negotiation have failed, then the staff investigating the matter shall seek authorization for the subpoena from the Director of the Division of Enforcement. No subpoena shall be issued unless the Director, in consultation with the General Counsel, has authorized its issuance.",

            "(i) Subpoenas should be negotiated with counsel for the member of the news media to narrowly tailor the request for only essential information. In negotiations with counsel, the staff should attempt to accommodate the interests of the Commission in the information with the interests of the media.",
            "(j) Subpoenas should, wherever possible, be directed at material information regarding a limited subject matter, should cover a reasonably limited period of time, and should avoid requiring production of a large volume of unpublished material. They should give reasonable and timely notice of their demand for documents.",
            "(k) In the absence of special circumstances, subpoenas to members of the news media should be limited to the verification of published information and to surrounding circumstances relating to the accuracy of published information.",
            "(l) Because the intent of this policy statement is to protect freedom of the press, news gathering functions, and news media sources, this policy statement does not apply to demands for purely commercial or financial information unrelated to the news gathering function.",

          "heading": "\u00a7 202.12   Policy statement concerning cooperation by individuals in its investigations and related enforcement actions.",
          "paragraphs": [
            "Cooperation by individuals and entities in the Commission's investigations and related enforcement actions can contribute significantly to the success of the agency's mission. Cooperation can enhance the Commission's ability to detect violations of the federal securities laws, increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the Commission's investigations, and provide important evidence for the Commission's enforcement actions. There is a wide spectrum of tools available to the Commission and its staff for facilitating and rewarding cooperation by individuals, ranging from taking no enforcement action to pursuing reduced charges and sanctions in connection with enforcement actions. As with any cooperation program, there exists some tension between the objectives of holding individuals fully accountable for their misconduct and providing incentives for individuals to cooperate with law enforcement authorities. This policy statement sets forth the analytical framework employed by the Commission and its staff for resolving this tension in a manner that ensures that potential cooperation arrangements maximize the Commission's law enforcement interests. Although the evaluation of cooperation requires a case-by-case analysis of the specific circumstances presented, as described in greater detail below, the Commission's general approach is to determine whether, how much, and in what manner to credit cooperation by individuals by evaluating four considerations: the assistance provided by the cooperating individual in the Commission's investigation or related enforcement actions (\u201cInvestigation\u201d); the importance of the underlying matter in which the individual cooperated; the societal interest in ensuring that the cooperating individual is held accountable for his or her misconduct; and the appropriateness of cooperation credit based upon the profile of the cooperating individual. In the end, the goal of the Commission's analysis is to protect the investing public by determining whether the public interest in facilitating and rewarding an individual's cooperation in order to advance the Commission's law enforcement interests justifies the credit awarded to the individual for his or her cooperation.",
            "(a) Assistance provided by the individual. The Commission assesses the assistance provided by the cooperating individual in the Investigation by considering, among other things:",
            "(1) The value of the individual's cooperation to the Investigation including, but not limited to:",
            "(i) Whether the individual's cooperation resulted in substantial assistance to the Investigation;",
            "(ii) The timeliness of the individual's cooperation, including whether the individual was first to report the misconduct to the Commission or to offer his or her cooperation in the Investigation, and whether the cooperation was provided before he or she had any knowledge of a pending investigation or related action;",
            "(iii) Whether the Investigation was initiated based on information or other cooperation provided by the individual;",
            "(iv) The quality of cooperation provided by the individual, including whether the cooperation was truthful, complete, and reliable; and",
            "(v) The time and resources conserved as a result of the individual's cooperation in the Investigation.",
            "(2) The nature of the individual's cooperation in the Investigation including, but not limited to:",
            "(i) Whether the individual's cooperation was voluntary or required by the terms of an agreement with another law enforcement or regulatory organization;",
            "(ii) The types of assistance the individual provided to the Commission;",
            "(iii) Whether the individual provided non-privileged information, which information was not requested by the staff or otherwise might not have been discovered;",
            "(iv) Whether the individual encouraged or authorized others to assist the staff who might not have otherwise participated in the Investigation; and",
            "(v) Any unique circumstances in which the individual provided the cooperation.",
            "(b) Importance of the underlying matter. The Commission assesses the importance of the Investigation in which the individual cooperated by considering, among other things:",

            "(i) Whether the subject matter of the Investigation is a Commission priority;",

            "(ii) The type of harm resulting from or threatened by the underlying violations; and",
            "(iii) The number of individuals or entities harmed.\n1",
            "(c) Interest in holding the individual accountable. The Commission assesses the societal interest in holding the cooperating individual fully accountable for his or her misconduct by considering, among other things:",

            "(2) The culpability of the individual, including, but not limited to, whether the individual acted with scienter, both generally and in relation to others who participated in the misconduct;",
            "(3) The degree to which the individual tolerated illegal activity including, but not limited to, whether he or she took steps to prevent the violations from occurring or continuing, such as notifying the Commission or other appropriate law enforcement agency of the misconduct or, in the case of a violation involving a business organization, by notifying members of management not involved in the misconduct, the board of directors or the equivalent body not involved in the misconduct, or the auditors of such business organization of the misconduct;",
            "(4) The efforts undertaken by the individual to remediate the harm caused by the violations including, but not limited to, whether he or she paid or agreed to pay disgorgement to injured investors and other victims or assisted these victims and the authorities in the recovery of the fruits and instrumentalities of the violations; and",
            "(5) The sanctions imposed on the individual by other federal or state authorities and industry organizations for the violations involved in the Investigation.",
            "(d) Profile of the individual. The Commission assesses whether, how much, and in what manner it is in the public interest to award credit for cooperation, in part, based upon the cooperating individual's personal and professional profile by considering, among other things:",
            "(1) The individual's history of lawfulness, including complying with securities laws or regulations;",
            "(2) The degree to which the individual has demonstrated an acceptance of responsibility for his or her past misconduct; and",
            "(3) The degree to which the individual will have an opportunity to commit future violations of the federal securities laws in light of his or her occupation\u2014including, but not limited to, whether he or she serves as: A licensed individual, such as an attorney or accountant; an associated person of a regulated entity, such as a broker or dealer; a fiduciary for other individuals or entities regarding financial matters; an officer or director of public companies; or a member of senior management\u2014together with any existing or proposed safeguards based upon the individual's particular circumstances."

An attorney who reports evidence of a material violation to such a qualified legal compliance committee has satisfied his or her obligation to report such evidence and is not required to assess the issuer's response to the reported evidence of a material violation.",

            "This section addresses when a company must include a shareholder's proposal in its proxy statement and identify the proposal in its form of proxy when the company holds an annual or special meeting of shareholders. In summary, in order to have your shareholder proposal included on a company's proxy card, and included along with any supporting statement in its proxy statement, you must be eligible and follow certain procedures. Under a few specific circumstances, the company is permitted to exclude your proposal, but only after submitting its reasons to the Commission. We structured this section in a question-and-answer format so that it is easier to understand. The references to \u201cyou\u201d are to a shareholder seeking to submit the proposal.",
            "(a) Question 1: What is a proposal? A shareholder proposal is your recommendation or requirement that the company and/or its board of directors take action, which you intend to present at a meeting of the company's shareholders. Your proposal should state as clearly as possible the course of action that you believe the company should follow. If your proposal is placed on the company's proxy card, the company must also provide in the form of proxy means for shareholders to specify by boxes a choice between approval or disapproval, or abstention. Unless otherwise indicated, the word \u201cproposal\u201d as used in this section refers both to your proposal, and to your corresponding statement in support of your proposal (if any).",
            "(b) Question 2: Who is eligible to submit a proposal, and how do I demonstrate to the company that I am eligible? (1) To be eligible to submit a proposal, you must satisfy the following requirements:",
            "(i) You must have continuously held:",
            "(A) At least $2,000 in market value of the company's securities entitled to vote on the proposal for at least three years; or",
            "(B) At least $15,000 in market value of the company's securities entitled to vote on the proposal for at least two years; or",
            "(C) At least $25,000 in market value of the company's securities entitled to vote on the proposal for at least one year; and",
            "(ii) You must provide the company with a written statement that you intend to continue to hold the requisite amount of securities, determined in accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A) through (C) of this section, through the date of the shareholders' meeting for which the proposal is submitted; and",
            "(iii) You must provide the company with a written statement that you are able to meet with the company in person or via teleconference no less than 10 calendar days, nor more than 30 calendar days, after submission of the shareholder proposal. You must include your contact information as well as business days and specific times that you are available to discuss the proposal with the company. You must identify times that are within the regular business hours of the company's principal executive offices. If these hours are not disclosed in the company's proxy statement for the prior year's annual meeting, you must identify times that are between 9 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. in the time zone of the company's principal executive offices. If you elect to co-file a proposal, all co-filers must either:",
            "(A) Agree to the same dates and times of availability, or",
            "(B) Identify a single lead filer who will provide dates and times of the lead filer's availability to engage on behalf of all co-filers; and",
            "(iv) If you use a representative to submit a shareholder proposal on your behalf, you must provide the company with written documentation that:",
            "(A) Identifies the company to which the proposal is directed;",
            "(B) Identifies the annual or special meeting for which the proposal is submitted;",
            "(C) Identifies you as the proponent and identifies the person acting on your behalf as your representative;",
            "(D) Includes your statement authorizing the designated representative to submit the proposal and otherwise act on your behalf;",
            "(E) Identifies the specific topic of the proposal to be submitted;",
            "(F) Includes your statement supporting the proposal; and",
            "(G) Is signed and dated by you.",
            "(v) The requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section shall not apply to shareholders that are entities so long as the representative's authority to act on the shareholder's behalf is apparent and self-evident such that a reasonable person would understand that the agent has authority to submit the proposal and otherwise act on the shareholder's behalf.",
            "(vi) For purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, you may not aggregate your holdings with those of another shareholder or group of shareholders to meet the requisite amount of securities necessary to be eligible to submit a proposal.",
            "(2) One of the following methods must be used to demonstrate your eligibility to submit a proposal:",
            "(i) If you are the registered holder of your securities, which means that your name appears in the company's records as a shareholder, the company can verify your eligibility on its own, although you will still have to provide the company with a written statement that you intend to continue to hold the requisite amount of securities, determined in accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A) through (C) of this section, through the date of the meeting of shareholders.",
            "(ii) If, like many shareholders, you are not a registered holder, the company likely does not know that you are a shareholder, or how many shares you own. In this case, at the time you submit your proposal, you must prove your eligibility to the company in one of two ways:",
            "(A) The first way is to submit to the company a written statement from the \u201crecord\u201d holder of your securities (usually a broker or bank) verifying that, at the time you submitted your proposal, you continuously held at least $2,000, $15,000, or $25,000 in market value of the company's securities entitled to vote on the proposal for at least three years, two years, or one year, respectively. You must also include your own written statement that you intend to continue to hold the requisite amount of securities, determined in accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A) through (C) of this section, through the date of the shareholders' meeting for which the proposal is submitted; or",
            "(B) The second way to prove ownership applies only if you were required to file, and filed, a Schedule 13D (\u00a7 240.13d-101), Schedule 13G (\u00a7 240.13d-102), Form 3 (\u00a7 249.103 of this chapter), Form 4 (\u00a7 249.104 of this chapter), and/or Form 5 (\u00a7 249.105 of this chapter), or amendments to those documents or updated forms, demonstrating that you meet at least one of the share ownership requirements under paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A) through (C) of this section. If you have filed one or more of these documents with the SEC, you may demonstrate your eligibility to submit a proposal by submitting to the company:",
            "(1) A copy of the schedule(s) and/or form(s), and any subsequent amendments reporting a change in your ownership level;",
            "(2) Your written statement that you continuously held at least $2,000, $15,000, or $25,000 in market value of the company's securities entitled to vote on the proposal for at least three years, two years, or one year, respectively; and",
            "(3) Your written statement that you intend to continue to hold the requisite amount of securities, determined in accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A) through (C) of this section, through the date of the company's annual or special meeting.",
            "(c) Question 3: How many proposals may I submit? Each person may submit no more than one proposal, directly or indirectly, to a company for a particular shareholders' meeting. A person may not rely on the securities holdings of another person for the purpose of meeting the eligibility requirements and submitting multiple proposals for a particular shareholders' meeting.",
            "(d) Question 4: How long can my proposal be? The proposal, including any accompanying supporting statement, may not exceed 500 words.",
            "(e) Question 5: What is the deadline for submitting a proposal? (1) If you are submitting your proposal for the company's annual meeting, you can in most cases find the deadline in last year's proxy statement. However, if the company did not hold an annual meeting last year, or has changed the date of its meeting for this year more than 30 days from last year's meeting, you can usually find the deadline in one of the company's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q (\u00a7 249.308a of this chapter), or in shareholder reports of investment companies under \u00a7 270.30d-1 of this chapter of the Investment Company Act of 1940. In order to avoid controversy, shareholders should submit their proposals by means, including electronic means, that permit them to prove the date of delivery.",
            "(2) The deadline is calculated in the following manner if the proposal is submitted for a regularly scheduled annual meeting. The proposal must be received at the company's principal executive offices not less than 120 calendar days before the date of the company's proxy statement released to shareholders in connection with the previous year's annual meeting. However, if the company did not hold an annual meeting the previous year, or if the date of this year's annual meeting has been changed by more than 30 days from the date of the previous year's meeting, then the deadline is a reasonable time before the company begins to print and send its proxy materials.",
            "(3) If you are submitting your proposal for a meeting of shareholders other than a regularly scheduled annual meeting, the deadline is a reasonable time before the company begins to print and send its proxy materials.",
            "(f) Question 6: What if I fail to follow one of the eligibility or procedural requirements explained in answers to Questions 1 through 4 of this section? (1) The company may exclude your proposal, but only after it has notified you of the problem, and you have failed adequately to correct it. Within 14 calendar days of receiving your proposal, the company must notify you in writing of any procedural or eligibility deficiencies, as well as of the time frame for your response. Your response must be postmarked, or transmitted electronically, no later than 14 days from the date you received the company's notification. A company need not provide you such notice of a deficiency if the deficiency cannot be remedied, such as if you fail to submit a proposal by the company's properly determined deadline. If the company intends to exclude the proposal, it will later have to make a submission under \u00a7 240.14a-8 and provide you with a copy under Question 10 below, \u00a7 240.14a-8(j).",
            "(2) If you fail in your promise to hold the required number of securities through the date of the meeting of shareholders, then the company will be permitted to exclude all of your proposals from its proxy materials for any meeting held in the following two calendar years.",
            "(g) Question 7: Who has the burden of persuading the Commission or its staff that my proposal can be excluded? Except as otherwise noted, the burden is on the company to demonstrate that it is entitled to exclude a proposal.",
            "(h) Question 8: Must I appear personally at the shareholders' meeting to present the proposal? (1) Either you, or your representative who is qualified under state law to present the proposal on your behalf, must attend the meeting to present the proposal. Whether you attend the meeting yourself or send a qualified representative to the meeting in your place, you should make sure that you, or your representative, follow the proper state law procedures for attending the meeting and/or presenting your proposal.",
            "(2) If the company holds its shareholder meeting in whole or in part via electronic media, and the company permits you or your representative to present your proposal via such media, then you may appear through electronic media rather than traveling to the meeting to appear in person.",
            "(3) If you or your qualified representative fail to appear and present the proposal, without good cause, the company will be permitted to exclude all of your proposals from its proxy materials for any meetings held in the following two calendar years.",
            "(i) Question 9: If I have complied with the procedural requirements, on what other bases may a company rely to exclude my proposal? (1) Improper under state law: If the proposal is not a proper subject for action by shareholders under the laws of the jurisdiction of the company's organization;",
            "(2) Violation of law: If the proposal would, if implemented, cause the company to violate any state, federal, or foreign law to which it is subject;",
            "(3) Violation of proxy rules: If the proposal or supporting statement is contrary to any of the Commission's proxy rules, including \u00a7 240.14a-9, which prohibits materially false or misleading statements in proxy soliciting materials;",
            "(4) Personal grievance; special interest: If the proposal relates to the redress of a personal claim or grievance against the company or any other person, or if it is designed to result in a benefit to you, or to further a personal interest, which is not shared by the other shareholders at large;",
            "(5) Relevance: If the proposal relates to operations which account for less than 5 percent of the company's total assets at the end of its most recent fiscal year, and for less than 5 percent of its net earnings and gross sales for its most recent fiscal year, and is not otherwise significantly related to the company's business;",
            "(6) Absence of power/authority: If the company would lack the power or authority to implement the proposal;",
            "(7) Management functions: If the proposal deals with a matter relating to the company's ordinary business operations;",
            "(8) Director elections: If the proposal:",
            "(i) Would disqualify a nominee who is standing for election;",
            "(ii) Would remove a director from office before his or her term expired;",
            "(iii) Questions the competence, business judgment, or character of one or more nominees or directors;",
            "(iv) Seeks to include a specific individual in the company's proxy materials for election to the board of directors; or",
            "(v) Otherwise could affect the outcome of the upcoming election of directors.",
            "(9) Conflicts with company's proposal: If the proposal directly conflicts with one of the company's own proposals to be submitted to shareholders at the same meeting;",
            "(10) Substantially implemented: If the company has already substantially implemented the proposal;",
            "(11) Duplication: If the proposal substantially duplicates another proposal previously submitted to the company by another proponent that will be included in the company's proxy materials for the same meeting;",
            "(12) Resubmissions. If the proposal addresses substantially the same subject matter as a proposal, or proposals, previously included in the company's proxy materials within the preceding five calendar years if the most recent vote occurred within the preceding three calendar years and the most recent vote was:",
            "(i) Less than 5 percent of the votes cast if previously voted on once;",
            "(ii) Less than 15 percent of the votes cast if previously voted on twice; or",
            "(iii) Less than 25 percent of the votes cast if previously voted on three or more times.",
            "(13) Specific amount of dividends: If the proposal relates to specific amounts of cash or stock dividends.",
            "(j) Question 10: What procedures must the company follow if it intends to exclude my proposal? (1) If the company intends to exclude a proposal from its proxy materials, it must file its reasons with the Commission no later than 80 calendar days before it files its definitive proxy statement and form of proxy with the Commission. The company must simultaneously provide you with a copy of its submission. The Commission staff may permit the company to make its submission later than 80 days before the company files its definitive proxy statement and form of proxy, if the company demonstrates good cause for missing the deadline.",
            "(2) The company must file six paper copies of the following:",
            "(i) The proposal;",
            "(ii) An explanation of why the company believes that it may exclude the proposal, which should, if possible, refer to the most recent applicable authority, such as prior Division letters issued under the rule; and",
            "(iii) A supporting opinion of counsel when such reasons are based on matters of state or foreign law.",
            "(k) Question 11: May I submit my own statement to the Commission responding to the company's arguments?",
            "Yes, you may submit a response, but it is not required. You should try to submit any response to us, with a copy to the company, as soon as possible after the company makes its submission. This way, the Commission staff will have time to consider fully your submission before it issues its response. You should submit six paper copies of your response.",
            "(l) Question 12: If the company includes my shareholder proposal in its proxy materials, what information about me must it include along with the proposal itself?",
            "(1) The company's proxy statement must include your name and address, as well as the number of the company's voting securities that you hold. However, instead of providing that information, the company may instead include a statement that it will provide the information to shareholders promptly upon receiving an oral or written request.",
            "(2) The company is not responsible for the contents of your proposal or supporting statement.",
            "(m) Question 13: What can I do if the company includes in its proxy statement reasons why it believes shareholders should not vote in favor of my proposal, and I disagree with some of its statements?",
            "(1) The company may elect to include in its proxy statement reasons why it believes shareholders should vote against your proposal. The company is allowed to make arguments reflecting its own point of view, just as you may express your own point of view in your proposal's supporting statement.",
            "(2) However, if you believe that the company's opposition to your proposal contains materially false or misleading statements that may violate our anti-fraud rule, \u00a7 240.14a-9, you should promptly send to the Commission staff and the company a letter explaining the reasons for your view, along with a copy of the company's statements opposing your proposal. To the extent possible, your letter should include specific factual information demonstrating the inaccuracy of the company's claims. Time permitting, you may wish to try to work out your differences with the company by yourself before contacting the Commission staff.",
            "(3) We require the company to send you a copy of its statements opposing your proposal before it sends its proxy materials, so that you may bring to our attention any materially false or misleading statements, under the following timeframes:",
            "(i) If our no-action response requires that you make revisions to your proposal or supporting statement as a condition to requiring the company to include it in its proxy materials, then the company must provide you with a copy of its opposition statements no later than 5 calendar days after the company receives a copy of your revised proposal; or",
            "(ii) In all other cases, the company must provide you with a copy of its opposition statements no later than 30 calendar days before its files definitive copies of its proxy statement and form of proxy under \u00a7 240.14a-6."

The fund must determine market impacts by first establishing a market impact factor for each security, which is a good faith estimate of the percentage change in the value of the security if it were sold, per dollar of the amount of the security that would be sold if the fund sold a pro rata amount of each security in its portfolio to satisfy the amount of net redemptions under current market conditions and, second, multiplying the market impact factor by the dollar amount of the security that would be sold. A fund may assume a market impact of zero for its daily liquid assets and weekly liquid assets.",

For purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, a fund may estimate costs and market impacts for each type of security with the same or substantially similar characteristics and apply those estimates to all securities of that type rather than analyze each security separately.",

            "(iii) Securities subject to conditional demand features. A security that is subject to a conditional demand feature (\u201cunderlying security\u201d) may be determined to be an eligible security only if:",

            "(2) A depository institution shall not be required to send the confirmation or safekeeping receipt required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section to a customer that is a non-U.S. citizen residing outside the United States or a foreign corporation, partnership, or trust, if such customer expressly waives in writing the right to receive such confirmation or safekeeping receipt.",
