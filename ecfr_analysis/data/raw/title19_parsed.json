Persons paying by charge or credit card will remain liable for all such charges until paid. Information as to those credit card companies authorized by Customs may be obtained from Customs officers.",
            "(8) Participants in the Automated Broker Interface may use statement processing as described in \u00a7 24.25 of this part. Statement processing allows entry/entry summaries and entry summaries to be grouped by either importer or by filer, and allows payment of related duties, taxes and fees by a single payment, rather than by individual checks for each entry. The preferred method of payment for users of statement processing is by Automated Clearinghouse.",

Where the amount of the check is over $25, the Customs cashier or other employee authorized to receive Customs collections will ensure that the payor's name, home and business telephone number (including area code), and date of birth are recorded on the face (front) side of the monetary instrument. In addition, one of the following will be recorded on the face side of the instrument: preferably, the payor's social security number or, alternatively, a current passport number or current driver's license number (including issuing state). A personal check received under this paragraph and a United States Government check, traveler's check, or money order received under paragraph (a) of this section by such Customs inspectors and other Customs employees shall also be subject to the following conditions:",
            "(1) Where the amount is less than $100 and the identification requirements of paragraph (a)(4) of this section have been met, the Customs employee accepting the check or money order will place his name and badge number on the collection voucher and place the serial number or other form of voucher identification on the face side of the check or money order so that the check or money order can be easily associated with the voucher.",
            "(2) Where the amount is $100 or more, in addition to the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section the Customs employee accepting the check or money order shall obtain the approval of the Customs officer in charge who also shall personally verify the identification data and indicate his approval by initialing the collection voucher below the signature of the Customs employee who approved the receipt of the check or money order.",
            "(3) A personal check tendered in accordance with this paragraph shall be accepted only when drawn for the amount of the duties, taxes, fees, and other charges to be paid by such check.",
            "(c) Checks on foreign banks, foreign travelers' checks, and commercial drafts or bills of exchange subject to acceptance by the drawees shall not be accepted.",
            "(d) Checks and other negotiable papers covering duties, taxes, fees, interest, and other Customs charges shall be made payable to the United States Customs Service.",

This charge shall be in addition to any unpaid duties, taxes, fees, interest, and other charges."

If the importer desires the additional privilege of depositing estimated tax payments on an extended deferred basis, it must be specifically requested. An importer who receives approval from the Center director to defer such payments may, however, continue to pay the estimated import taxes due at the time of entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption.",
            "(b) Deferred payment periods. A period shall commence on October 24 and run through October 31, 1965; thereafter the periods shall run from the 1st day of each month through the 15th day of that month, and from the 16th day of each month through the last day of that month. An importer may begin the deferral of payments of estimated tax to a Customs port in the first deferral period beginning after the date of the written approval by the Center director.

(1) An importer must state his estimate of the largest amount of taxes to be deferred in any semimonthly period based on the largest amount of import taxes on alcoholic beverages deposited with CBP in such a period during the year preceding his application. He must also identify any existing bond or bonds that he has on file with CBP and shall submit in support of his application the approval of the surety on his bond or bonds to the use of the procedure and to the increase of such bond or bonds to such larger amount or amounts as may be found necessary by the Center director.",

            "(h) Termination of deferred payment privilege. (1) When any bill on Customs Form 6084 for deferred taxes is not paid within the period specified in paragraph (f) of this section, a demand for payment shall be made to the surety on the importer's bond. If in the opinion of the customs officer concerned such failure to make timely payment of estimated deferred taxes warrants the withdrawal of the tax deferral privilege, he will advise the importer of the withdrawal of such privilege. In all instances of failure to pay timely the deferred taxes on alcoholic beverages withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, further withdrawals from the warehouse entry on which the tax is delinquent will be refused until payment is made of the amount delinquent.",
            "(2) The termination at any port of the tax deferral privilege for failure to pay timely any deferred estimated tax shall be at the discretion of the Customs officer concerned. Termination of the privilege for any other reason shall be subject to the approval of the Commissioner of Customs. Notice of termination of the tax deferral privilege at any port will be disseminated to all other Customs ports.",
            "(3) Renewal of the tax deferral privilege after it has been withdrawn at any port may be made only upon approval of the Commissioner of Customs.",

The deferred payment privilege once approved by the port director or Center director before January 19, 2017, or the Center director on or after January 19, 2017, will remain in effect until terminated under the provisions of paragraph (h) or the importer or surety requests termination.",

Customs Form 5106 contains blocks for a two-digit suffix code which may be written in as an addition to the Internal Revenue Service employer identification number to provide optional additional identification. The two-digit suffix code may be used by a business firm having branch office operations to permit the firm to identify transactions originating in its branch offices, or by vessel owners to permit them to identify transactions associated with particular vessels. A separate Customs Form 5106 shall be required to report the specific suffix code and the name and address for each branch office or vessel to be identified. Transactions may be associated with a specific branch office or vessel by reporting the appropriate identification number, including the two-digit suffix code, on Customs Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent, or the request for services. Suffix codes may be either numeric, alphabetic, or a combination of both numeric and alphabetic, except that the letters O, Z, and I may not be used.

An importer identification number shall remain on file until 1 year from the date on which it is last used on Customs Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent, or a request for services. If not used for 1 year and there is no outstanding transaction to which it must be associated, the importer identification number will be removed from Customs files.

When a Customs Officer's regularly-scheduled shift occurs in part on a Sunday, the officer shall receive Sunday differential pay for those hours of the work which are performed during the 24 hour period of the Sunday, and the night differential pay for those hours which do not fall on the Sunday. For example, a Customs Officer who is assigned and works a shift which starts at 8 p.m. Sunday and ends at 4 a.m. Monday, shall receive 4 hours of Sunday premium pay and 4 hours of night pay. The night differential pay shall be calculated based on the rate applicable to the particular tour of duty.",
            "(h) Limitations. Total payments for overtime/commute, and differentials for holiday, Sunday, and night work that a Customs Officer is paid shall not exceed any applicable fiscal year pay cap established by Congress. The Commissioner of Customs or the Commissioner's designee may waive this limitation in individual cases to prevent excessive costs or to meet emergency requirements of the Customs Service. However, compensation awarded to a Customs Officer for work not performed, which includes overtime awards during military leave or court leave, continuation of pay under workers compensation law, and awards made in accordance with back pay settlements, shall not be applied to any applicable pay cap calculations."

Subject to the exemptions and special rules of this section, when cargo is loaded on a commercial vessel at a port within the definition of this section to be transported between ports in the U.S. or is unloaded from a commercial vessel at a port within the definition of this section after having been transported between ports in the U.S., the shipper (the person or corporation who pays the freight) of that cargo is liable for the payment of the port use fee at the time of unloading. The fee will be imposed only once on a movement pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section. The fee is to be based upon the value of the cargo as determined by standard commercial documentation where such documentation is available. Otherwise, the value is to be determined under 19 U.S.C. 1401a as if it were imported merchandise. The Vessel Operation Report (Army Corps of Engineers Form 3925) is to be completed and submitted to the Army Corps of Engineers in accordance with the procedures set forth in 33 CFR Ch. II, part 207.

Subject to the exemptions and special rules of this section, when imported cargo is unloaded from a commercial vessel at a port within the definition of this section, and destined for either consumption, warehousing, or foreign trade zone admission, the importer of that cargo, or in the case of foreign trade zones, the person or corporation responsible for bringing merchandise into the zone, is liable for the payment of the port use fee at the time of unloading. The fee is based on the CBP appraised value of the shipment pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1401a, the same basis as that used for duty payment. The fee will be collected on all formal entries, including warehouse entries and temporary importation under bond entries, and admissions into foreign trade zones.",
            "(ii) Fee payment. The port use fee on unloading of imported cargo must be paid in accordance with the normal CBP collection procedures set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 24.1 and 141.1 of this chapter, except as provided for merchandise admitted into foreign trade zones in paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section. The CBP Entry Summary Form (CBP Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent), is to be completed with the amount of the fee shown and identified on the form.

            "(iii) Foreign Trade Zones. In cases where imported cargo is unloaded from a commercial vessel at a port within the definition of this section and admitted into a foreign trade zone, the applicant for admission (the person or corporation responsible for bringing merchandise into the zone) who becomes liable for the fee at the time of unloading pursuant to paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section, must pay all fees for which he is liable on a quarterly basis in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section by submitting to CBP a Harbor Maintenance Fee Quarterly Summary Report, CBP Form 349. The CBP Form 349 must either be submitted electronically to CBP using the Automated Clearinghouse (ACH) via an Internet account established by the payer and located at http://www.pay.gov or, alternatively, mailed with a single check or money order payable to U.S. Customs and Border Protection to the Office of Administration, Revenue Division, Customs and Border Protection, using the current address posted at Forms.CBP.gov. Fees must be paid for all shipments unloaded and admitted to the zone, or in the case of direct deliveries under \u00a7\u00a7 146.39 and 146.40 of this chapter, unloaded and received in the zone under the bond of the foreign trade zone operator.",
            "(3) Passengers\u2014(i) Time and place of liability. Subject to the exemptions and special rules of this section, when a passenger boards or disembarks a commercial vessel at a port within the definition of this section, the operator of that vessel is liable for the payment of the port use fee. The fee is to be based upon the value of the actual charge for transportation paid by the passenger or on the prevailing charge for comparable service if no actual charge is paid. The vessel operator on each cruise is liable only once for the port use fee for each passenger.",
            "(ii) Fee payment. The operator of the passenger-carrying vessel must pay the accumulated fees for which he is liable on a quarterly basis in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section by submitting to CBP a Harbor Maintenance Fee Quarterly Summary Report, CBP Form 349.

            "(4) Refunds and supplemental payments\u2014(i) General. To make supplemental payments or seek refunds of harbor maintenance fees paid relative to the unloading of imported cargo, the procedures applicable to supplemental payments or refunds of ordinary duties must be followed. To seek refunds of quarterly-paid harbor maintenance fees pertaining to export movements, the procedures set forth in paragraph (e)(4)(iv) of this section must be followed. To make supplemental payments on any quarterly-paid harbor maintenance fee or seek refunds of quarterly-paid harbor maintenance fees pertaining to other than export movements, the procedures set forth in paragraph (e)(4)(iii) must be followed.",
            "(ii) Time limit for refund requests. A refund request must be received by CBP within one year of the date the fee for which the refund is sought was paid to CBP or, in the case of fees paid relative to imported merchandise admitted into a foreign trade zone and subsequently withdrawn from the zone under 19 U.S.C. 1309, within one year of the date of withdrawal from the zone.",
            "(iii) For fees paid on other than export movements. If a supplemental payment is made for any quarterly-paid harbor maintenance fee or a refund is requested relative to quarterly fee payments previously made regarding the loading or unloading of domestic cargo, the unloading of cargo destined for admission into a foreign trade zone, or the boarding or disembarking of passengers, the refund request or supplemental payment must be accompanied by a Harbor Maintenance Fee Amended Quarterly Summary Report, CBP Form 350, along with a copy of the Harbor Maintenance Fee Quarterly Summary Report, CBP Form 349, for the quarter(s) covering the payment to which the refund request or supplemental payment relates. A request for a refund must specify the grounds for the refund. Supplemental payments and HMF refund requests, accompanied by the requisite CBP Forms 350 and 349 and, if applicable, supporting documentation, must be submitted electronically to CBP using the Automated Clearinghouse (ACH) via an Internet account established by the payer and located at http://www.pay.gov or, alternatively, mailed to the Office of Administration, Revenue Division, Customs and Border Protection, using the current address posted at Forms.CBP.gov. If a supplemental payment is mailed, a single check or money order payable to U.S. Customs and Border Protection must be attached to each CBP Form 350. Approved HMF refund payments will be made via ACH to those payers who are enrolled in the ACH refund program; all others will receive HMF refund payments via mail.",
            "(iv) For fees paid on export movements. CBP will process refund requests relative to fee payments previously made regarding the loading of cargo for export as follows:",
            "(A) Refund request. For export fee payments made prior to July 1, 1990, the exporter (the name that appears on the SED or equivalent documentation authorized under 15 CFR 30.39(b)) or its agent must submit a letter of request for a refund specifying the grounds for the refund and identifying the specific payments made. The letter must be accompanied by the proof of payment set forth in paragraph (e)(4)(iv)(C) of this section. For export fee payments made on or after July 1, 1990, supporting documentation is not required with the refund request. For these payments, the request must specify the grounds for the refund, identify the quarters for which a refund is sought, and contain the following additional information: the exporter's name, address, and employer identification number (EIN); the name and EIN of any freight forwarder or other agent that made export fee payments on the exporter's behalf; and a name, telephone number, and facsimile number of a contact person. Refund requests must either be submitted electronically to CBP using the Automated Clearinghouse (ACH) via an Internet account established by the payer and located at http://www.pay.gov or, alternatively, mailed to the Office of Administration, Revenue Division, Customs and Border Protection, using the current address posted at Forms.CBP.gov. Approved HMF refund payments will be made using the ACH to those payers who are enrolled in the ACH refund program; all others will receive HMF refund payments via mail.",
            "(B) Refund procedure\u2014(1) Processing order; power of attorney. Generally, a properly filed refund request will be processed in the chronological order of its receipt. A refund request filed on behalf of an exporter by an agent other than a freight forwarder must be supported by a power of attorney or letter signed by the exporter authorizing the representation. A refund request filed by an agent other than a freight forwarder that lacks a power of attorney or authorization letter will not be processed unless one or the other is submitted. A refund request filed by a freight forwarder does not require a power of attorney or authorization letter to be processed; however, if CBP has not received a power of attorney or authorization letter for an exporter covered in a freight forwarder's refund request and that exporter has filed a separate refund request on its own behalf, that freight forwarder's entire refund request will be removed from the chronological processing order and processed after the processing of all exporter refund requests is completed.",
            "(2) HMT Payment Report and Report/Certification. In processing a request for a refund, CBP will conduct a search of its records (CBP electronic database and paper document sources) and produce for issuance to the exporter (or its agent, as appropriate) a \u201cHarbor Mantenance Tax Payment Report\u201d (HMT Payment Report) that lists all payments reflected in those records for the entire period the fee was in effect. CBP will also produce for issuance to the exporter a \u201cHarbor Maintenance Tax Refund Report and Certification\u201d (Report/Certification) that lists all payments supported by paper documentation, either retained by CBP (relative to payments made on and after July 1, 1990) or submitted by the exporter with its refund request (relative to payments made at any time the fee was in effect). Where a refund request was filed on the exporter's behalf by an agent other than a freight forwarder, a power of attorney or authorization letter must be filed with CBP before CBP will issue these reports. The Report/Certification sets forth the total amount of the refund that CBP believes it owes the exporter for the payments listed in that report (minus any previous refunds). Pre-July 1, 1990, payments listed in the HMT Payment Report for which paper documentation has not been provided by the exporter will not be listed in the Report/Certification. The exporter has 120 days from the date the HMT Payment Report and the Report/Certification are issued (the 120-day period) to sign and return to CBP the Report/Certification in order to receive the refund set forth in that report and/or to submit to CBP a request for a Revised Report/Certification. Where the exporter chooses to receive the refund set forth in the Report/Certification, the exporter must sign and return the report to CBP. CBP will issue the refund upon receipt of the signed report.",
            "(3) Revised Report/Certification. A request for a Revised Report/Certification must be accompanied by documentation to support any payments not listed in the Report/Certification or corrections to listed payments. See paragraph (e)(4)(iv)(C) of this section regarding acceptable documentation. If an exporter (or its agent, as appropriate) both signs and returns to CBP a Report/Certification and requests a Revised Report/Certification, CBP will not, when reviewing the request for a Revised Report/Certification, approve for refund any corrections to the payments that were listed in the signed Report/Certification; CBP will, however, in that circumstance, consider approving any additional payments that were not listed in the signed Report/Certification. If an exporter does not sign and return to CBP a Report/Certification, but requests a Revised Report/Certification, CBP will consider approving for refund corrections to the payments listed in the Report/Certification and additional payments. Where the exporter requests a Revised Report/Certification, CBP will review the documentation submitted with the request, make a determination, and, within 60 days of the request's receipt, issue a Revised Report/Certification that lists all payments approved for refund and the total amount of the refund owed. In order to receive the refund set forth in a Revised Report/Certification, the exporter must sign and return it to CBP. CBP will issue the refund upon its receipt of the signed report. An exporter, within the 120-day period, may submit additional requests for a Revised Report/Certification, with appropriate documentation, to cover any payments not approved for refund in a Revised Report/Certification previously issued by CBP.",
            "(4) Protest. For purposes of filing a protest under 19 U.S.C. 1514 (and 19 CFR part 174), unless issuance of a Revised Report/Certification is pending, any payments not approved for refund in a Report/Certification or a Revised Report/Certification issued by CBP within the 120-day period will be considered denied as of the date the period expires; a protest covering such payments must be filed within 180 days of that date. For any payments not approved for refund in a Revised Report/Certification issued after expiration of the 120-day period, a protest may be filed within 180 days of that report's issuance.",
            "(5) Significance of signed Report/Certification and Revised Report/Certification. A Report/Certification or Revised Report/Certification must be signed by an officer of the company duly authorized to bind the company or by an agent (such as a broker or freight forwarder) representing the exporter in seeking a refund under this section. A Report/Certification or Revised Report/Certification signed by the exporter or its agent and received by CBP constitutes the exporter's agreement that the amount of the refund set forth in the report is accurate and CBP's payment of that refund amount is in full accord and satisfaction of all payments approved for refund in the report. The signed Report/Certification or Revised Report/Certification also represents the exporter's release, waiver, and abandonment of all claims, excluding claims for interest, against the Government, its officers, agents, and assigns for costs, attorney fees, expenses, compensatory damages, and exemplary damages arising out of the payments approved for refund in the report. When an agent, including a freight forwarder, signs a Report/Certification or Revised Report/ Certification on behalf of an exporter(s), the agent certifies that it is acting on the exporter's behalf and will use due diligence to forward the refund to the exporter, and, in the event the agent does not forward the refund to the exporter, will notify CBP and return the refund to CBP within one year of its receipt of the refund. Upon receipt of the signed Report/Certification or Revised Report/Certification, CBP releases, waives, and abandons all claims other than fraud against the exporter, its officers, agents, or employees arising out of all payments approved for refund in the report.",
            "(C) Documentation. For payments made prior to July 1, 1990, supporting documentation is required to obtain a refund and must be submitted in accordance with paragraphs (e)(4)(iv)(A) and/or (B)(3) of this section. For payments made on and after July 1, 1990, supporting documentation is not required to obtain a refund, unless the exporter seeks to prove corrections of payments listed in the Report/Certification (if the exporter did not sign and return it to CBP) and/or additional payments not listed in a Report/Certification, in accordance with paragraph (e)(4)(iv)(B)(3) of this section. The supporting documentation that CBP will accept as establishing entitlement to a refund, whether submitted with a refund request or a request for a Revised Report/Certification, is whichever of the following documents CBP accepted with the payment at the time it was made: a copy of the Export Vessel Movement Summary Sheet; where an Automated Summary Monthly Shipper's Export Declaration was filed, a copy of a letter containing the exporter's identification, its employer identification number (EIN), the Census Bureau reporting symbol, and, the quarter for which the payment was made; or a copy of a Harbor Maintenance Fee Quarterly Summary Report, CBP Form 349, for the quarter covering the refund requested. CBP also will consider other documentation offered as proof of payment of the fee, such as cancelled checks and/or affidavits from exporters attesting to the fact that all quarterly harbor maintenance tax payments made by the exporter were made exclusively for exports, and will accept that other documentation as establishing entitlement for a refund only if it clearly proves the payments were made for export harbor maintenance fees in the amounts sought to be refunded and were made by the party requesting the refund or the party on whose behalf the refund was requested.",
            "(f) Quarterly payments. All quarterly payments required by this section must be received no later than 31 days after the close of the quarter being paid. Quarterly periods end on the last day of March, June, September, and December.",
            "(g) Maintenance of records. Each importer, applicant for admission of cargo into a foreign trade zone, shipper and cruise vessel operator affected by this section must maintain all such documentation necessary for CBP to verify the accuracy of fee computations and to otherwise determine compliance under the law. Such documentation must be maintained for a period of 5 years from the date of fee calculation. The affected parties must advise the Director, Revenue Division, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, at the current address posted at Forms.CBP.gov, of the name, address, email and telephone number of a responsible officer who is able to verify any records required to be maintained under this paragraph. The Director, Revenue Division, must be promptly notified of any changes in the identifying information submitted. The records must be maintained and made available for inspection, copying, reproduction or other official use by CBP in accordance with the provisions of part 163 of this chapter.",
            "(h) Penalties/liquidated damages for failure to pay harbor maintenance fee and file summary sheet\u2014(1) Amount of penalty or damages. Any party (including the importer, or shipper) who fails to pay the harbor maintenance fee and file the summary sheet at the time specified by regulation will incur a penalty equal to the amount of liquidated damages assessable for late filing of an entry summary pursuant to the provisions of \u00a7 142.15 of this chapter. An importer will be liable for payment of liquidated damages under the basic importation and entry bond, for failure to pay the harbor maintenance fee, as provided in such bond.",
            "(2) Application for relief. The party must follow the procedures set forth in part 171 of this chapter in filing an application for relief. Any application to cancel liquidated damages incurred must be made in accordance with part 172 of this chapter.",
            "(3) Mitigation. Any penalty assessed under this provision will be mitigated in a manner consistent with guidelines relating to cancellation of claims for liquidated damages for late filing of entry summaries. Any liquidated damages assessed under this provision will be mitigated in a manner consistent with guidelines published by the authority of the Commissioner of CBP for cancellation of claims for untimely payment of estimated duties, taxes and charges.",
            "(i) Privacy Act notice. Whenever an identification number is requested on the summary sheets provided for in paragraph (e) of this section, the disclosure of the social security number is mandatory when an internal revenue service number is not disclosed. Identification numbers are solicited under the authority of Executive Order 9397 and Pub. L. 99-662. The identification number provides unique identification of the party liable for the payment of the harbor maintenance fee. The number will be used to compare the information on the summary sheets with information submitted to the government on other forms required in the course of shipping or importing merchandise, which contain the identification number, e.g., Vessel Operation Report, to verify that the information submitted is accurate and current. Failure to disclose an identification number may cause a penalty pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section. The above information is set forth pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974 (Pub. L. 93-579)."

The preferred method of payment is by Automated Clearinghouse (ACH) debit or ACH credit, except where the importer of record has provided a separate check payable to the \u201cU.S. Customs and Border Protection\u201d for customs charges (duties, taxes, or other debts owed CBP (see \u00a7 111.29(b) of this chapter)). A particular statement payment must be accomplished entirely through ACH or completely by check or cash. A mixing of payment methods for a single statement will not be accepted. ACH debit (see paragraph (b)(2) of this section) is an arrangement in which the filer electronically provides payment authorization for the Treasury-designated ACH processor to perform an electronic debit to the payer's bank account; ACH credit is described in \u00a7 24.26. The payment amount will then be automatically credited to the account of the Department of the Treasury. If a filer chooses to use statement processing for entries of quota-class merchandise and other special classes of merchandise designated by CBP Headquarters under \u00a7 142.13(b) of this chapter, he must also use statement processing as a normal course of business for the largest possible portion (see \u00a7 24.25(d)) of his eligible non-special class entries; further, he must use the ACH payment mechanism to pay all his ABI statements containing entries for quota-class merchandise. In no circumstance will check or cash be acceptable for payment of ABI statements containing entries for quota-class merchandise.",
            "(b) How to elect participation\u2014(1) Statement processing. An ABI filer must notify CBP in writing of the intention to utilize statement processing.",
            "(2) Automated Clearinghouse debit. If an ABI filer pays his statements through ACH debit, rather than by check, he must provide to CBP the bank routing number and the bank account number for each account from which ACH payments are to be electronically debited. Upon the determination by CBP that the ABI filer has the necessary software to participate and otherwise qualifies to participate in ACH, CBP shall assign a unique identifying payer's unit number to the participant and the Treasury-designated ACH processor. This unique number assigned by CBP will alert the ACH processor as to which bank and account to issue the electronic debit. If a client of a ABI filer opts to pay CBP charges from his own account through an ABI filer, the client must provide directly to CBP the bank transit routing number and the bank account number for each of his accounts from which ACH payments can be electronically debited. CBP will then assign a unique payer's unit number to each of his accounts and provide the assigned unit number directly to the client and the Treasury-designated ACH processor. The client would then provide the appropriate payer's unit number to his broker to pay his statements through ABI. It is the responsibility of the participant to ensure that all bank account information is accurate and that the correct unique payer's unit number is utilized for each ACH transaction.",
            "(c) Procedure for filer. (1) The filer shall transmit entry/entry summary and entry summary data through ABI indicating whether payment for a particular entry summary will be by individual check or by using statement processing. If statement processing is indicated, the filer shall designate whether the entry summary is to be grouped by importer or broker, and shall provide a valid scheduled statement date (within 10 days of entry, but not a Saturday, Sunday or holiday).",
            "(2) CBP shall provide a preliminary statement to the ABI filer on the scheduled statement date. The preliminary statement shall contain all entry/entry summaries and entry summaries scheduled for that statement date. The preliminary statement shall be printed by the filer, who will review the statement entries and the statement totals, assemble the required entry summaries as listed in the statement, and present them to CBP with the preliminary statement. This presentation must be made within 10 working days after entry of the merchandise. If a filer elects to perform deletions from the preliminary statement (other than items related to special classes of merchandise provided for in \u00a7 142.13(b) of this chaper), the filer shall notify CBP in such manner as designated by CBP Headquarters. Any entry number deleted from a statement may be paid by an individual check or scheduled for another statement by transmitting the entry summary data through ABI with a future payment date.",
            "(3) The ABI filer using statement processing is responsible for ensuring that payment is made within 10 days of the entry of the related merchandise.",
            "(4) Payments made through ACH are processed as follows:",
            "(i) Payment date; interest and liquidated damages. The date of acceptance of the ACH debit payment authorization or ACH credit payment for the preliminary statement is the payment date when determining compliance with the due date for scheduled statements and for purposes of \u00a7 24.3a of this part, and subject to the provisions of \u00a7 113.62(a)(1)(i) and (m)(4) of this chapter.",
            "(ii) Issuance of final statement. CBP shall, upon confirmation from the Department of the Treasury that funds are available and transferred to CBP, identify the final statement as paid and post the appropriate amounts to the related entries.",
            "(iii) Evidence of payment. The final statement generally shall be available to the filer the day following the receipt of the ACH payment by CBP. The final statement may be utilized as evidence that statement payment has occurred through an ACH transaction. In other instances, a cancelled check may serve as evidence of payment.",
            "(d) Choice of excluding certain entries from statement processing. An ABI filer using statement processing, generally, has the right to inform CBP electronically whether he desires that a particular entry summary be paid by individual payment or through statement processing. If a filer opts to use statement processing for entry/entry summaries for quota-class and other special classes of merchandise defined in \u00a7 142.13(b) of this chapter, he shall use statement processing in the normal course of business for the largest possible portion of his eligible non-special class entries also; further, he shall pay for these entry/entry summaries through ACH. If a filer opts to use statement processing and, therefore, ACH for entry/entry summaries for special classes of merchandise defined in \u00a7 142.13(b) of this chapter, these entry/entry summaries cannot be deleted from a statement. A filer who excludes or deletes entries from the statement process and ACH should be prepared to articulate a sound business reason why these exclusions or deletions have occurred. If CBP believes that a broker is using ACH for his quota-class entries and not using statement processing and ACH for the largest possible portion of his eligible non-special class entries, the ABI participant may be consulted by CBP as to why he has not used statement processing and ACH for certain entries. If CBP is not satisfied, after such consultation, that there were sound articulable business reasons for the exclusion or deletion of non-special class entries, CBP may disqualify the participant from using statement processing/ACH for quota-class entries.",
            "(e) Scheduled statement date. Entry/entry summaries and entry summaries must be designated for statement processing within 10 working days after the date of entry. It is the responsibility of the ABI filer using statement processing to ensure that the elected scheduled statement date is within that 10-day timeframe. CBP will not warn the filer if the scheduled statement date given is late."

          "paragraphs": [
            "(a) Description. Automated Clearinghouse (ACH) credit is an optional payment method that allows a payer to transmit statement processing payments (see \u00a7 24.25) or deferred tax payments (see \u00a7 24.4) or bill payments (see \u00a7 24.3) electronically, through its financial institution, directly to the CBP account maintained by the Department of the Treasury.",
            "(b) Enrollment procedure. A payer interested in enrolling in the ACH credit program must indicate such interest by providing the following information to the National Finance Center, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Office of Administration, Revenue Division, 6650 Telecom Drive, Suite 100, Indianapolis, IN 46278: Payer name and address; payer contact name(s); payer telephone number(s) and facsimile number; payer identification number (importer number or Social Security number or CBP assigned number); and 3-digit filer code.",
            "(c) Routing and format instructions. Following receipt of the enrollment information, the National Finance Center will provide the payer with specific ACH credit routing and format instructions and will advise the payer that the following information must be provided to its financial institution when originating its payments: Company name; company contact person name and telephone number; company identification number (coded Internal Revenue Service employer identification number or DUNS number or CBP assigned number); company payment description; effective date; receiving company name; transaction code; CBP transit routing number and CBP account number; payment amount; payer identifier (importer number or Social Security number or CBP assigned number or filer code if the payer is a broker who is the importer of record); document number (daily statement number, entry or warehouse withdrawal number for a deferred tax payment, or bill number); payment type code; settlement date; and document payment amount.",
            "(d) Prenotification procedure. Before effecting any payments of funds through the ACH credit process, the payer must follow a prenotification procedure, involving a non-funds message transmission through its financial institution to the CBP account, in order to validate the routing instructions. When the routing instructions are validated, the National Finance Center will notify the payer that the prenotification transaction has been accepted and that payments may be originated on or after the tenth calendar day following the prenotification acceptance date.",
            "(e) Payment origination procedures\u2014(1) General. Once the payer has received authorization to begin originating ACH credit payments under paragraph (d) of this section, the payer, through its financial institution, must originate each payment transaction to the CBP account no later than one business day prior to the payment due date. The payer's account will be charged by the financial institution on the settlement date identified in the transaction. The payer is responsible for following the routing and format instructions provided by CBP and for ensuring the accuracy of the information when originating each payment. Improperly formatted or erroneous information provided by the payer will delay the prompt posting of the payment to the receivable.",
            "(2) Procedures for daily statement filers. The procedures set forth in \u00a7 24.25(c) for ABI filers using statement processing remain applicable when payment is effected through ACH credit. However, when the ABI filer is a customs broker who is not the importer of record and thus is not responsible for the payment, the ABI filer must provide the statement number and statement amount to the importer of record at least one business day prior to the due date so that the importer of record can originate the payment.",
            "(f) Date of collection. The date that the ACH credit payment transaction is received by CBP shall be the collection date which equates to the settlement date. The appropriate daily statement or entry or warehouse withdrawal or bill shall be identified as paid as of that collection date.",
            "(g) Removal from the ACH credit program. If a payer repeatedly provides improperly formatted or erroneous information when originating ACH credit payments, the National Finance Center may advise the payer in writing to refrain from using ACH credit and to submit its payments by bank draft or check pursuant to \u00a7 24.1 or, in the case of daily statement payments, to use the ACH debit payment method under \u00a7 24.25."

All persons listed in \u00a7 163.2 must maintain all records required by law and regulation for the required retention periods and as original records, whether paper or electronic, unless alternative storage methods have been adopted in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. The records, whether in their original format or under an alternative storage method, must be capable of being retrieved upon lawful request or demand by CBP.",
            "(b) Alternative method of storage\u2014(1) General. Any of the persons listed in \u00a7 163.2 may maintain any records, other than records required to be maintained as original records under laws and regulations administered by other Federal government agencies, in an alternative format, provided that the person gives advance written notification of such alternative storage method to the Regulatory Audit, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, 2001 Cross Beam Dr., Charlotte, North Carolina 28217, and provided further that the Director of Regulatory Audit, Charlotte office does not instruct the person in writing as provided herein that certain described records may not be maintained in an alternative format. The written notice to the Director of Regulatory Audit, Charlotte office must be provided at least 30 calendar days before implementation of the alternative storage method, must identify the type of alternative storage method to be used, and must state that the alternative storage method complies with the standards set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. If an alternative storage method covers records that pertain to goods under CBP seizure or detention or that relate to a matter that is currently the subject of an inquiry or investigation or administrative or court proceeding, the appropriate CBP office may instruct the person in writing that those records must be maintained as original records and therefore may not be converted to an alternative format until specific written authorization is received from that CBP office. A written instruction to a person under this paragraph may be issued during the 30-day advance notice period prescribed in this section or at any time thereafter, must describe the records in question with reasonable specificity but need not identify the underlying basis for the instruction, and shall not preclude application of the planned alternative storage method to other records not described therein.",

Methods commonly used in standard business practice for storage of records include, but are not limited to, machine readable data, CD ROM, and microfiche. Methods that are in compliance with generally accepted business standards will generally satisfy CBP requirements, provided that the method used allows for retrieval of records requested within a reasonable time after the request and provided that adequate provisions exist to prevent alteration, destruction, or deterioration of the records. The following standards must be applied by recordkeepers when using alternative storage methods:",
            "(i) Operational and written procedures are in place to ensure that the imaging and/or other media storage process preserves the integrity, readability, and security of the information contained in the original records.

If a person listed in \u00a7 163.2 uses an alternative storage method for records that is not in compliance with the conditions and requirements of this section, CBP may issue a written notice informing the person of the facts giving rise to the notice and directing that the alternative storage method must be discontinued in 30 calendar days unless the person provides written notice to the issuing CBP office within that time period that explains, to CBP's satisfaction, how compliance has been achieved. Failure to timely respond to CBP will result in CBP requiring discontinuance of the alternative storage method until a written statement explaining how compliance has been achieved has been received and accepted by CBP."

In conducting an audit under this section, regardless of the finality of liquidation under 19 U.S.C. 1514, CBP auditors have the sole discretion to determine the time period and scope of the audit and will examine a sufficient number of transactions, as determined solely by CBP. In addition to examining all transactions to identify loss of duties, taxes, and fees under 19 U.S.C. 1592 or loss of revenue under 19 U.S.C. 1593a, or to determine compliance with any other applicable customs laws or other laws enforced by CBP, CBP auditors, at their sole discretion, may use statistical sampling methods. During the audit, CBP auditors will explain the sampling plan and how the results of the sampling will be projected over the universe of transactions for purposes of calculating lost duties, taxes, and fees or lost revenue and, where appropriate, overpayments and over-declarations eligible for offsetting under paragraph (d) of this section. The person being audited and CBP will discuss the specifics of the sampling plan before audit work under the plan is commenced. Once the sampling plan is accepted, the audited person waives the ability to contest the validity of the sampling plan or its methodology at a later date and challenges of the sampling will be limited to challenging computational and clerical errors. CBP's authority to conduct the audit or employ statistical sampling is not dependent on the audited person's acceptance of the specifics of the sampling plan. An audited person's acceptance of the sampling plan and methodology must be in writing and signed by a management official with authority to bind the company in matters of trade, imports, and/or other affairs under the customs laws, CBP regulations, or other applicable laws. The audited person may submit the signed waiver to the CBP auditor. The appropriate field director, Regulatory Audit, will sign the waiver for CBP. Where the sampling plan or methodology is subsequently adjusted or modified, at CBP's discretion, acceptance of the adjustments or modifications also must be in writing and signed. This is not a waiver of the audited person's right to later contest substantive issues, such as misclassification, undervaluation, etc., that may properly be raised under applicable regulations, including in a request for CBP Headquarters advice under 19 CFR 171.14, a request for CBP Headquarters review under 19 CFR 162.74(c), a response to a prepenalty notice issued by CBP under 19 U.S.C. 1592(b)(1) or 19 U.S.C. 1593a(b)(1), a petition submitted in response to a penalty notice issued by CBP under 19 U.S.C. 1592(b)(2) or 19 U.S.C. 1593a(b)(2) (19 CFR part 171) and 19 U.S.C. 1618, a supplemental petition submitted under 19 CFR 171.61 and 171.62, or any action commenced in a court of proper jurisdiction.",
            "(2) Projection. For purposes of this section, \u201cprojection\u201d of sampling results over the universe of transactions is the process by which the results obtained from the sample entries actually examined are applied to the universe of entries set within the time period and scope of the sampling plan to yield a reliable assessment of that which is sought to be ascertained or measured in the audit, including, but not limited to, lost duties or revenue, or overpayments or over-declarations, as described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.",
            "(3) When CBP uses statistical sampling. CBP auditors have the sole discretion to use statistical sampling techniques when:",
            "(i) Review of 100 percent of the transactions is impossible or impractical;",
            "(ii) The sampling plan is prepared in accordance with generally recognized sampling procedures; and",
            "(iii) The sampling procedure is executed in accordance with that plan.",
            "(4) Statistical sampling by audited persons under CBP supervision. CBP may authorize a person being audited to conduct, under CBP supervision, self-testing of its own transactions within the time period and scope of the audit as originally set or later modified by CBP at its discretion. Audited persons permitted in advance by CBP to conduct self-testing of certain transactions under CBP supervision within the time period and scope of a CBP audit may use statistical sampling methods, provided that the criteria contained in paragraph (c)(3) of this section are satisfied. CBP will determine the time period and scope of the CBP-approved and supervised self-testing and will explain any sampling plan to be employed in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The execution and results of the self-testing and the sampling plan are subject to CBP approval, and the audited person is subject to the waiver of paragraph (c)(1) of this section.",
            "(5) Statistical sampling by a private party submitting a prior disclosure. A private party conducting an independent review of certain transactions and a calculation of lost duties, taxes, and fees or lost revenue for purposes of prior disclosure, in accordance with 19 CFR 162.74(j), may use statistical sampling, provided that the private party submits an explanation of the sampling plan and methodology employed and that the criteria in paragraph (c)(3) of this section are satisfied. Where the private party submits a prior disclosure employing statistical sampling, the time period, scope, and any sampling plan employed by the private party, as well as the execution and results of the self-review, are subject to CBP review and approval. Where CBP and the private party discuss and accept the sampling plan and methodology, or an adjustment to it, the waiver of paragraph (c)(1) of this section applies.",
            "(d) Offset of overpayments and over-declarations in 19 U.S.C. 1592 penalty cases\u2014(1) General. In conducting any audit authorized under 19 U.S.C. 1509 and this section for the purpose of calculating the loss of duties, taxes, and fees or monetary penalty under any provision of 19 U.S.C. 1592, CBP auditors identifying overpayments of duties or fees or over-declarations of quantities or values that are within the time period and scope of the audit, as established solely by CBP, will treat the overpayments or over-declarations on finally liquidated entries as an offset to any underpayments or under-declarations also identified on finally liquidated entries, provided that:",
            "(i) The identified overpayments or over-declarations were not made by the person being audited for the purpose of violating any provision of law, including laws other than customs laws,",
            "(ii) The identified underpayments or under-declarations were not made knowingly and intentionally, and",
            "(iii) All other requirements of this paragraph (d) are met.",
            "(2) When audited person conducts self-testing under CBP supervision. Offsetting will apply to self-testing conducted by an audited person under CBP supervision (i.e., during a CBP audit), provided that all requirements of this paragraph (d) are met, CBP approves the self-testing in advance and, upon review of the self-testing, CBP approves its execution and results.",
            "(3) When a private party submits a prior disclosure. Offsetting will apply when a private party submits a prior disclosure, provided that the prior disclosure is in accordance with 19 CFR 162.74 and CBP approves the private party's self-review, including its execution and results. CBP's Office of International Trade, Regulatory Audit will review and evaluate all such prior disclosures and approve offsetting where it is satisfied that the requirements of 19 U.S.C. 1509(b)(6) and this paragraph (d) are met.",
            "(4) Time period and scope determined by CBP; projection when sampling employed. In conducting an audit under paragraph (d)(1) of this section or authorizing an audited person's self-testing as described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, CBP will have the sole authority to determine the time period and scope of the audit. In conducting a review of a private party's prior disclosure as described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the time period and scope employed will be subject to CBP approval. In each of these circumstances, where statistical sampling is involved, CBP auditors will examine only the selected sample transactions. The results of the sample examination, with respect to properly identified overpayments and over-declarations and properly identified underpayments and under-declarations, will be projected over the universe of transactions to determine the total overpayments and over-declarations that are eligible for offsetting and to determine the total loss of duties, taxes, and fees.",
            "(5) Same acts, statements, omissions, or entries not required. Offsetting may be permitted where the overpayments or over-declarations were not made by the same acts, statements, or omissions that caused the underpayments or under-declarations, and is not limited to the same entries that evidence the underpayments or under-declarations, provided that they are within the time period and scope of the audit as established by CBP and as described in paragraph (d)(4) of this section.",
            "(6) Limitations. Offsetting will not be allowed with respect to specific overpayments or over-declarations made for the purpose of violating any provision of law, including laws other than customs laws. Offsetting will not be allowed with respect to overpayments or over-declarations resulting from a failure to timely claim or establish a duty allowance or preference. Offsetting will be disallowed entirely where CBP determines that any underpayments or under-declarations identified for offsetting purposes were made knowingly and intentionally.",
            "(7) Audit report. Where overpayments or over-declarations have been identified in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the audit report will state whether they have been made within the time period and scope of the audit.",
            "(8) Disallowance determinations referred to Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures office. Any determination that offsets will be disallowed where overpayments/over-declarations were made for the purpose of violating any law, or where underpayments or under-declarations were made knowingly and intentionally, will be made by the appropriate Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures (FP&F) office to which the issue was referred. CBP will notify the audited person of a determination whether to allow offsetting in whole or in part. The FP&F office will issue a notice of penalty under 19 U.S.C. 1592(b) and/or notice of liability for lost duties, taxes, and fees under 19 U.S.C. 1592(d) where it determines that such action is warranted. If the FP&F office issues a notice of penalty, the audited person may file a petition under 19 U.S.C. 1592(b)(2), 19 U.S.C. 1618, and 19 CFR part 171 to challenge the action.",
            "(9) Refunds limited. An overpayment of duties and fees will only be credited toward a refund if the circumstances of the overpayment meet the requirements of 19 U.S.C. 1520 or the requirements of 19 U.S.C. 1514(a) pertaining to clerical error, mistake of fact, or other inadvertence in any entry, liquidation, or reliquidation.",
            "(e) Sampling not evidence of reasonable care. The fact that entries were previously within the time period and scope of an audit conducted by CBP in which sampling was employed, in any circumstances described in this section, is not evidence of reasonable care by a violator in any subsequent action involving such entries.",
            "(f) Exception to procedures. The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section may not apply when a private party submits a prior disclosure under paragraph (d)(3) of this section. Paragraphs (a)(5), (a)(6), (b), (d)(8), and (d)(9) of this section do not apply once CBP and/or ICE commences an investigation with respect to the issue(s) involved."

The Recordkeeping Compliance Program is a voluntary CBP program under which certified recordkeepers may be eligible for alternatives to penalties (see paragraph (d) of this section) that might be assessed under \u00a7 163.6 for failure to produce a demanded entry record. However, even where a certified recordkeeper is eligible for an alternative to a penalty, participation in the Recordkeeping Compliance Program has no limiting effect on the authority of CBP to use a summons, court order or other legal process to compel the production of records by that certified recordkeeper.",
            "(b) Certification procedures\u2014(1) Who may apply. Any person described in \u00a7 163.2(a) who is required to maintain and produce entry records under this part may apply to participate in the Recordkeeping Compliance Program.",
            "(2) Where to apply. An application for certification to participate in the Recordkeeping Compliance Program must be submitted to the Regulatory Audit, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, 2001 Cross Beam Dr., Charlotte, North Carolina 28217. The application must be submitted in accordance with the guidelines contained in the CBP Recordkeeping Compliance Handbook which may be obtained by downloading it from CBP's Regulatory Audit Web site located at http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/import/regulatory_audit_program/archive/compliance_assessment/ or by writing to the Recordkeeping Compliance Program, Executive Director, Regulatory Audit, Office of International Trade, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, 1300 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20229.",
            "(3) Certification requirements. A recordkeeper may be certified as a participant in the Recordkeeping Compliance Program after meeting the general recordkeeping requirements established under this section or after negotiating an alternative program suited to the needs of the recordkeeper and CBP. To be certified, a recordkeeper must be in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. CBP will take into account the size and nature of the importing business and the volume of imports and CBP workload constraints prior to granting certification. In order to be certified, a recordkeeper must meet the applicable requirements set forth in the CBP Recordkeeping Compliance Handbook and must be able to demonstrate that it:",
            "(i) Understands the legal requirements for recordkeeping, including the nature of the records required to be maintained and produced and the time periods relating thereto;",
            "(ii) Has in place procedures to explain the recordkeeping requirements to those employees who are involved in the preparation, maintenance and production of required records;",
            "(iii) Has in place procedures regarding the preparation and maintenance of required records, and the production of such records to CBP;",

For purposes of this paragraph, the term \u201cvariance\u201d means a deviation from the Recordkeeping Compliance Program that does not involve a failure to maintain or produce records or a failure to meet the requirements set forth in this section. For purposes of this paragraph, the term \u201cviolation\u201d means a deviation from the Recordkeeping Compliance Program that involves a failure to maintain or produce records or a failure to meet the requirements set forth in this section.",
            "(c) Application review and approval and certification process\u2014(1) Review of applications. The Charlotte regulatory audit field office will process the application and will coordinate and consult, as may be necessary, with the appropriate CBP Headquarters and field officials. The Charlotte regulatory audit field office will review and verify the information contained in the application and may initiate an on-site verification prior to approval and certification. If an on-site visit is warranted, the Charlotte regulatory audit field office will inform the applicant. If additional information is necessary to process the application, the applicant will be notified. CBP requests for information not submitted with the application or for additional explanation of details will cause a delay in the application approval and certification of applicants and may result in the suspension of the application approval and certification process until the requested information is received by CBP.",

A willful failure to produce demanded entry records or repeated failures to produce demanded entry records may result in the issuance of penalties under \u00a7 163.6(b) and removal of certification under the program (see \u00a7 163.13) until corrective action satisfactory to CBP is taken.",
            "(2) Contents of notice. A notice of violation issued to a participant in the Recordkeeping Compliance Program for failure to produce a demanded entry record or information contained therein must:",

The steel import license can be applied for up to 60 days prior to the expected date of importation and until the date of filing of the entry summary documents, or in the case of FTZ entries, the filing of Customs form 214. The steel import license is valid for 75 days; however, import licenses that were valid on the date of importation but expired prior to the filing of entry summary documents will be accepted.",
            "(e) Correcting submitted license information. Users will need to correct licenses themselves if they determine that there was an error submitted. To access a previously issued license, a user must log on with his user identification code and identify the license number and the volume (in kilograms) for the first product shown on the license. The information on the license should match the information presented on the CF-7501 entry summary document as closely as possible; this includes the value and volume of the shipment, the expected date of importation, and the customs district of entry.",
            "(f) Low-value licenses. There is one exception to the requirement for obtaining a unique license for each Customs entry. If the total value of the covered steel portion of an entry is less than $5,000, applicants may apply to Commerce for a low-value license that can be used in lieu of a single-entry license for low-value entries."

These products are listed on the Aluminum Import Monitoring and Analysis (AIM) system website (https://www.trade.gov/aluminum). Registered users will be able to obtain aluminum import licenses on the AIM system website. This website contains two sections related to import licensing\u2014the online registration system and the automatic aluminum import license issuance system. Aluminum import licenses must be provided to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP or Customs) as discussed in this section. Information gathered from these licenses will be aggregated and posted on the import monitoring section of the AIM system website.",
            "(2) A single license may cover multiple products as long as certain information on the license (e.g., importer, exporter, manufacturer and country of origin) remains the same. However, separate licenses for aluminum entered under a single entry will be required if the information differs. As a result, a single Customs entry may require more than one aluminum import license. The applicable license(s) must cover the total quantity of aluminum entered and should cover the same information provided on the Customs entry summary.",
            "(b) Entries for consumption. All entries for consumption of covered aluminum products, other than the exceptions discussed in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, will require an import license prior to the filing of Customs entry summary documents, or its electronic equivalent. The license number(s) must be reported on the entry summary (Customs Form 7501), or its electronic equivalent, at the time of filing. There is no requirement to present physical copies of the license forms at the time of entry summary. However, copies must be maintained in accordance with Customs' normal requirements. Entry summaries submitted without the required license number(s) will be considered incomplete and will be subject to liquidated damages for violation of the bond condition requiring timely completion of entry.",
            "(c) Foreign Trade Zone admissions. All shipments of covered aluminum products into a foreign trade zone (FTZ), known as FTZ admissions, will require an import license prior to the filing of FTZ admission documents, or its electronic equivalents. The license number(s) must be reported on the application for FTZ admission and/or status designation (Customs Form 214) at the time of filing. There is no requirement to present physical copies of the license forms at the time of FTZ admission; however, copies must be maintained in accordance with Customs' normal requirements. FTZ admission documents submitted without the required license number(s) will not be considered complete and will be subject to liquidated damages for violation of the bond condition requiring timely completion of admission. The aluminum license for FTZ admission does not expire, and a further aluminum license will not be required for shipments of entries for consumption from zones into the commerce of the United States.",
            "(d) Informal entries. No import license shall be required on informal entries of covered aluminum products, such as merchandise valued at less than $2,500. This exemption applies to informal entries only; imports of aluminum valued at less than $2,500 that are part of a formal entry will require a license. For additional information, refer to 19 CFR 143.21 through 143.28.",
            "(e) Other non-consumption entries. Import licenses are not required on temporary importation bond (TIB) entries, transportation and exportation (T&E) entries or entries into a bonded warehouse.
