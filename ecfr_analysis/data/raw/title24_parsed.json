            "(a) Any individual, regardless of age, may submit to the Department a request for access to records of the Department. The request should be made either in person at the Office of, or by mail addressed to, the responsible Privacy Act Officer. Although oral requests may be honored, a requester may be asked to submit his request in writing. The envelope containing the request and the letter itself should both clearly indicate that the subject is a PRIVACY ACT REQUEST FOR ACCESS TO RECORDS.",
            "(b) When a request for access to records is misdirected by the requester, or not addressed as specified in paragraph (a) of this section, the Department official receiving same shall promptly refer it to the appropriate Privacy Act Officer and the time of receipt for processing purposes will be the time when it is received by that official.",
            "(c) When a request for access to records fails to provide necessary information as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section the requester shall be advised that the time of receipt for processing purposes will be the time when the additional necessary information is received by the appropriate official.",
            "(d) The requirements for identification of individuals seeking access to records are as follows:",
            "(1) In person. Each individual making a request in person shall be required to present satisfactory proof of identity. The means of proof, in the order of preference and priority, are:",
            "(i) A document bearing the individual's photograph (for example, passport or military or civilian identification card);",
            "(ii) A document bearing the individual's signature (for example, driver's license, social security card, unemployment insurance book, employer's identification card, national credit card and professional, craft or union membership card); and",
            "(iii) A document bearing neither the photograph nor the signature of the individual (for example, a Medicaid card). In the event the individual can provide no suitable documentation of identity, the Department will require a signed statement asserting the individual's identity and stipulating that the individual understands the penalty provision of 5 U.S.C. 552a(i)(3). That penalty provision also appears at \u00a7 16.13(a). In order to avoid any unwarranted disclosure of an individual's records, the Department reserves the right to determine to its satisfaction whether proof of identity offered by any individual is adequate.",
            "(2) Not in person. If the individual making a request does not appear in person before a Privacy Act Officer, the information set forth in \u00a7 16.3(b)(1) and a certificate of a notary public or equivalent officer empowered to administer oaths must accompany the request. The certificate within or attached to the letter must be substantially in accord with the following text:",
            "(3) Parents of minors and legal guardians. An individual acting as the parent of a minor or the legal guardian of the individual to whom a record pertains shall establish his or her personal identity in the same manner prescribed in either paragraph (d) (1) or (2) of this section. In addition, such other individual shall establish his or her representative capacity of parent or legal guardian. In the case of the parent of a minor, the proof of identity shall be a certified or authenticated copy of the minor's birth certificate. In the case of a legal guardian of an individual who has been declared incompetent due to physical or mental incapacity or age by a court of competent jurisdiction, the proof of identity shall be a certified or authenticated copy of the court's order. A parent or legal guardian may act only for a living individual, not for a decedent. A parent or legal guardian may be accompanied during personal access to a record by another individual, provided the provisions of \u00a7 16.5(e) are satisfied.",
            "(e) When the provisions of this part are alleged to have the effect of impeding an individual in exercising his or her right to access, the Department will consider alternative suggestions from an individual making a request, regarding proof of identity and access to records.",

Unusual circumstances shall include circumstances where a search for and collection of requested records from inactive storage, field facilities or other establishments are required, cases where a voluminous amount of data is involved, instances where information on other individuals must be separated or expunged from the particular record, and cases where consultations with other agencies having a substantial interest in the determination of the request are necessary.",

This election would be appropriate, for example, when the record is in an automated data media such as tape or disc, when the record contains information on other individuals, and when deletion of information is permissible under exemptions (for example, 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2)). In no event shall original records of the Department be made available to the individual except under the immediate supervision of the Privacy Act Officer or his designee. It is a crime to conceal, mutilate, obliterate, or destroy any record filed in a public office, or to attempt to do any of the foregoing, Title 18, United States Code, 2701(a).",
            "(e) Any individual who requests access to a record pertaining to that individual may be accompanied by another individual of his or her choice. Accompanied includes discussion of the record in the presence of the other individual. The individual to whom the record pertains shall authorize the presence of the other individual by a signed and dated document which includes the name of the other individual and specifically describes the record to which access is sought. The other individual shall sign the authorization in the presence of the Privacy Act Officer. An individual shall not be required to state a reason or otherwise justify his or her decision to be accompanied by another individual during personal access to a record."

            "(2) From subsection (d)(1) because release of the records to an individual who may become or has become the subject of an investigation could interfere with pending or prospective law enforcement proceedings, constitute an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of third parties, reveal the identity of confidential sources, or reveal sensitive investigative techniques and procedures.",
            "(3) From subsection (d)(2) because amendment or correction of the records could interfere with pending or prospective law enforcement proceedings, or could impose an impossible administrative and investigative burden by requiring the office that maintains the records to continuously retrograde its verifications of tenant eligibility attempting to resolve questions of accuracy, relevance, timeliness and completeness.",
            "(4) From subsection (e)(1) because it is often impossible to determine relevance or necessity of information in pre-investigative early stages. The value of such information is a question of judgment and timing; what appears relevant and necessary when collected may ultimately be evaluated and viewed as irrelevant and unnecessary to an investigation. In addition, the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, or investigators, may obtain information concerning the violation of laws other than those within the scope of its jurisdiction. In the interest of effective law enforcement, the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, or investigators, should retain this information because it may aid in establishing patterns of unlawful activity and provide leads for other law enforcement agencies. Further, in obtaining the evidence, information may be provided which relates to matters incidental to the main purpose of the inquiry or investigation but which may be pertinent to the investigative jurisdiction of another agency. Such information cannot readily be identified.",

Tenant Eligibility Verification Files\u201d consists in part of material that may be used for the purpose of determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for Federal civilian employment or Federal contracts, the release of which would reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to the Government under an express promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence. Therefore, to the extent that information in this system falls within the coverage of subsection (k)(5) of the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5), the system is exempt from the requirements of the following subsection of the Privacy Act, for the reasons stated below.",
            "(1) From subsection (d)(1) because release would reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to the Government under an express promise of confidentiality. Revealing the identity of a confidential source could impede future cooperation by sources, and could result in harassment or harm to such sources."

Where the Department of Justice has rendered a decision denying representation of the employee pursuant to 28 CFR 50.15, the General Counsel shall seek the concurrence of the Department of Justice on the request. If the Department of Justice does not concur in the request, the General Counsel shall so advise the employee and no further action on the employee's request shall be taken.",

Information regarding the crediting of amounts saved is required in order to insure that the statutorily prescribed purpose of lowering the costs of construction is fulfilled by passing savings from the use of volunteers on to the sponsor or other body or agency undertaking the construction, rather than permitting the retention of any savings as a windfall by a contractor or subcontractor.

            "(1) Acquisition type. The applicant must state whether it is requesting acquisition of the property by lease, deed, or permit. A lease of one year, extendable at HHS's discretion, with the concurrence of GSA or the landholding agency, may be granted when the applicant's initial application is approved and the applicant's final application outlining the applicant's financial plan is found to be otherwise reasonable based on the criteria in paragraph (a)(7) of this section, but either a change in zoning is required or the financial plan proposes to utilize Low-Income Housing Tax Credits or other funding sources that typically take longer to process than other forms of financing. Applicants that initially apply for transfer by lease or permit and subsequently request transfer by deed will follow the same bifurcated application process, including deadlines, contained in 42 U.S.C. 11411. Should an applicant wish to transition from acquisition by lease to acquisition by deed, HHS will issue a letter of commitment to a lessee indicating that, provided its application meets all application criteria, including securing of all necessary financing that complies with Federal Government requirements, HHS will issue a deed.",

            "(3) Description of the property desired. The applicant must describe the listed property desired, including existing zoning. Applicants must certify that any modification(s) made to and use of the property will conform to all applicable building codes, and local use restrictions, or similar limitations. In accordance with GSA policy, determinations regarding parcelization are made prior to screening. Therefore, expressions of interest and applications for portions of listed properties will not be accepted.",
            "(4) Description of the proposed program. The applicant must fully describe the proposed program and plan of use, including implementation plans.",
            "(5) Demonstration of need. The applicant must demonstrate that the property is needed for homeless assistance purposes at the time of application and how the program will address the needs of the homeless population to be assisted. The applicant must demonstrate that it has an immediate need and ability to utilize all of the property for which it is applying.",
            "(6) Demonstrate that the property is suitable and adaptable for the proposed program and plan of use. The applicant must fully explain why the property is suitable and describe what, if any, modification(s) will be made to the property before the program becomes operational.",
            "(7) Ability to finance and operate the proposed program. If the applicant's initial application is approved, the applicant must set forth a reasonable plan to finance the approved program within 45 days of the initial approval. To be considered reasonable, the plan must, at a minimum:",
            "(i) Specifically describe all anticipated costs and sources of funding for the proposed program, including any property modifications;",

Deed transfers will only be made after an applicant demonstrates its financial plan adequately protects the Federal Government's interest in the property; and",
            "(vi) Neither subject the Federal Government's interest in the property to foreclosure nor impose obligations (e.g., extended use agreements) on the Federal Government.",

Each applicant under this part must certify in writing that it will comply with all requirements of Federal law and HHS policy, as amended, relating to non-discrimination, including the following: the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601-3619) and implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 100; and, as applicable, Executive Order 11063 (Equal Opportunity in Housing) and implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 107; Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d to d-4) (Non-discrimination in Federally Assisted Programs) and implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 1; section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act and implementing regulations at 45 CFR part 92; the prohibitions against discrimination on the basis of age under the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 (42 U.S.C. 6101-6107) and implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 146; and the prohibitions against discrimination against otherwise qualified individuals with disabilities under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) and implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 8; and Titles II or III of the Americans with Disabilities Act and implementing regulations at 28 CFR part 35 or 36, as applicable. The applicant must maintain the required records to demonstrate compliance with all applicable Federal laws and HHS policies related to non-discrimination.",
            "(9) Insurance and indemnification. The applicant must certify that it will insure the property against loss, damage, or destruction to protect the residual financial interest of the United States. The United States shall be named as an additional insured. Applicants must provide proof of insurance annually or upon request. Failure to maintain sufficient insurance may result in adverse action, including reversion of the property, at the discretion of HHS. In the event of a covered loss, the transferee must hold all insurance proceeds in trust and obtain written concurrence from HHS before disbursing the funds. Applicants, and all affiliated parties utilizing the property, as approved by HHS, must indemnify the United States and hold the United States harmless for all actions involving use of the property.",
            "(10) Historic preservation. Where applicable, the applicant must provide information that will enable HHS to comply with Federal historic preservation requirements.",
            "(11) Environmental information. The applicant must provide sufficient information to allow HHS to analyze the potential impact of the applicant's proposal on the environment, in accordance with the instructions provided with the application packet. HHS will assist applicants in obtaining any pertinent environmental information in the possession of HUD, GSA, or the landholding agency. However, the burden is on the applicant to submit sufficient documentation for analysis by HHS.",
            "(12) Local government notification. The applicant must certify that it has notified the applicable unit of general local government responsible for sewer, water, police, and fire services, in writing, of its proposed program for the specific property and submit a copy of that written notification.",
            "(13) Zoning and local use restrictions. An applicant requesting a deed must certify that it has consulted all State and local governmental entities that will have jurisdiction over the property and that the proposed use will comply with all applicable zoning and local use restrictions, including local building code requirements. An applicant that applies for a lease or permit is not required to comply with local zoning requirements, as long as the Federal Government retains ownership of the property. Deed transfers will only be made after the applicant has provided acceptable written proof that the proposed program is not in conflict with State or local zoning laws and restrictions, building codes, or similar limitations.",
            "(b) Scope of evaluations. Due to the short time frame imposed by statute for evaluating applications, HHS's evaluation will, generally, be limited to the information contained in the application. It is therefore incumbent on applicants to provide thorough and complete applications.",
            "(c) Deadline for initial application. An initial application must be received by HHS, at the email address in \u00a7 581.10(d)(1) or other address indicated by HHS, within 75 days after an expression of interest is received from a particular applicant for that property. Upon written request from the applicant, HHS may, in its discretion, grant extensions authorized by 42 U.S.C. 11411(e)(2)(A), provided that the appropriate landholding agency or GSA concurs with the extension.",
            "(d) Evaluation of initial application. (1) Upon receipt of an initial application, HHS will review it for completeness, and, if incomplete and time permits, may, in its discretion, return it or ask the applicant to furnish any missing or additional required information prior to final evaluation of the initial application.",
            "(2) HHS will evaluate each initial application within 10 days of receipt and will promptly advise the applicant of its decision. All initial applications will be reviewed on the basis of the following elements:",
            "(i) Services offered. The extent and range of proposed services, such as meals, shelter, job training, and counseling.",
            "(ii) Need. The demand for the program, the program's ability to satisfy unmet needs of the community, and the degree to which the available property will be fully utilized.",
            "(iii) Experience. Demonstrated ability to provide the services, such as prior success in operating similar programs and recommendations attesting to that fact by Federal, State, and local authorities.",
            "(e) Deadline and evaluation of final application. (1) If HHS approves an initial application, HHS will notify the applicant and provide the applicant 45 days in which to provide a final application. The final application shall set forth a reasonable plan to finance, as specified in paragraph (a)(7) of this section, the approved program as set forth in the initial application. Applicants may not modify the approved initial application within its final application proposal.",
            "(2) Upon receipt of the final application, HHS will make a determination within 15 days and notify the applicant.",
            "(3) Unlike with initial applications, requests for extensions are not authorized by 42 U.S.C. 11411 and thus will not be considered for final applications.",
            "(4) Applications are evaluated on a first-come, first-served basis. HHS will notify all organizations that have submitted expressions of interest for a particular property whether an earlier application received for that property has been approved.",
            "(f) Competing applications. If HHS receives more than one final application simultaneously, HHS will evaluate all applications and make a determination based on each application's merit. HHS will rank approved applications based on the elements listed in paragraph (a) of this section, and notify the landholding agency, or GSA, as appropriate, of the approved applicant."

Custody and accountability of the property will remain throughout the lease term with the landholding agency (i.e., the agency which initially reported the property as excess) and throughout the deed term with the transferee.",
            "(3) Prior to assignment to HHS, GSA may consider other Federal uses and other important national needs in deciding the disposition of surplus property. Priority of consideration will normally be given to uses to assist the homeless. However, both GSA and HHS may consider any competing request for the property made under 40 U.S.C. 550 that is so meritorious and compelling that it outweighs the needs of the homeless.",

The determination of whether a person meets this minimal level of performance must include consideration of those services that will be performed by a person's spouse, relatives or other attendants to be provided by the individual. For example, if a person requires assistance with cooking, preparing or serving food plus assistance in feeding himself or herself, the individual would meet the minimal performance level and thus satisfy the eating ADL, if a spouse, relative or attendant provides assistance with feeding the person. Should such assistance become unavailable at any time, the owner is not obligated at any time to provide individualized services beyond those offered to the resident population in general.

In determining the amount of savings recaptured on a project-by-project basis, as authorized by section 1012(b) of the McKinney Act, HUD will take into account the physical condition of the projects participating in the refunding which generate the McKinney Act savings and, if necessary, HUD will finance in refunding bond debt service correction of existing deficiencies which cannot be funded completely by existing project replacement reserves or by a portion of reserves released from the refunded bond's indenture. For McKinney Act refundings of projects which did not receive a Financing Adjustment Factor (\u201cFAF\u201d), HUD will allow up to 50 percent of debt service savings to be allocated to the project account; in which case, the remainder will be shared equally by the Agency and the U.S. Treasury.",
            "(f) For refundings of Section 8 projects other than McKinney Act Projects, and for all transactions which substitute collateral for, but do not redeem, outstanding obligations, and for which a HUD approval is needed (such as assignment of a HAPC or insured mortgage note), the Office of Multifamily Housing in consultation with HUD Field Office Counsel will review the HAPC, the Trust Indenture for the outstanding obligations, applicable HUD regulations, and reasonableness of proposed financing terms. In particular, HUD review should be obtained for the release of reserves from the trust indenture of the outstanding 11(b) bonds that are being refunded, defeased, or pre-paid. A proposal to distribute to a non-Federal entity the benefits of a refinancing, such as debt service savings and/or balances in reserves held under the original Trust Indenture, should be referred to the Office of Multifamily Housing for further review. In proposals submitted for HUD approval, HUD will consent to release reserves, as provided by the Trust Indenture, in an amount remaining after correction of project physical deficiencies and/or replenishment of replacement reserves, where needed. In the case of a refunding of 11(b) bonds by a public agency issuer which is the owner of the project and is entitled to reserves held under the Trust Indenture, HUD requires execution by the project owner of a use agreement, and amendment of a regulatory agreement, if applicable, to extend low-income tenant occupancy for ten years after expiration of the original HAPC term. In the case of HAP contracts with renewable 5-year terms, the Use Agreement shall extend for 10 years after the project owners first opt-out date. The Use Agreement may also be required of private entity owners, unless the refunding is incidental to a transfer of project ownership or a transaction which provides a substantial public benefit, as determined by the Office of Multifamily Housing. Proposed use of benefits shall be consistent with applicable appropriations law, the HAPC, and other requirements applicable to the original project financing, and the proposed financing terms must be reasonable in relation to bond market yields and transaction fees, as approved by the HUD Office of Multifamily Housing.",
            "(g) Agencies shall have wide latitude in the design of specific delivery vehicles for use of McKinney Act savings, subject to HUD audit of each Agency's performance in serving the targeted income eligible population. Savings may be used for shelter costs of providing housing, rental, or owner-occupied, to very low-income households through new construction, rehabilitation, repairs, and acquisition with or without rehab, including assistance to very low-income units in mixed-income developments. These include programs designed to assist in obtaining shelter, such as rent or homeownership subsidies. Self-sufficiency services in support of very low-income housing are also eligible, and may include, but are not limited to, homeownership counseling, additional security measures in high-crime areas, construction job training for residents' repair of housing units occupied by very low-income families, and empowerment activities designed to support formation and growth of resident entities. Except for the cost of providing third-party program audit reports to HUD, eligible costs exclude consultant fees or reimbursement of Agency staff expenses, but may include fees for professional services required in the Agency's McKinney Act programs of assistance to very low-income families. Unless otherwise specified by HUD in a McKinney Agreement, savings shall be subject to the above use requirements for 10 years from the date of receipt of the savings.",
            "(h) Refunding bonds, including interest thereon, approved under this Section shall be exempt from all taxation now or hereafter imposed by the United States, and the notification of approval of tax exemption shall not be subject to revocation by HUD. Whether refunding bonds approved under this section meet the requirements of Section 103 or any other provisions of the Internal Revenue Code is not within the responsibilities of HUD to determine. Such bonds shall be prepaid during the HAPC term only under such conditions as HUD shall require."

Such costs must not exceed, and ordinarily would be substantially less than, 90 percent of HUD's total development cost limit for the units proposed to be revitalized (100 percent of the total development cost limit for any \u201cinfill\u201d new construction subject to this regulation). The revitalization cost estimate used in the PHA's most recent comprehensive plan for modernization is to be used for this purpose, unless a PHA demonstrates or HUD determines that another cost estimate is clearly more realistic to ensure viability and to sustain the operating costs that are described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.",
            "(2) The overall projected cost of the revitalized development must not exceed the Section 8 cost under the method contained in the Appendix to this part, even if the cost of revitalization is a lower percentage of the TDC than the limits stated in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.",
            "(3) The source of funding for such a revitalization program must be identified and already available. In addition to other resources already available to the PHA, a PHA may assume that future formula funds provided through the Comprehensive Grant Program are available for this purpose, provided that they are sufficient to permit completion of the revitalization within the statutory five year time frame. (Comprehensive plans must be amended accordingly.)",
            "(b) Density. Density reduction measures would have to result in a public housing community with a density approaching that which prevails in the community for similar types of housing (typically family), or a lower density. If the development's density already meets this description, further reduction in density is not a requirement.",
            "(c) Income mix. (1) Measures generally will be required to broaden the range of resident incomes to include over time a significant mix of households with at least one full-time worker (for example, at least 20 percent with an income at least 30 percent of median area income). Measures to achieve a broader range of household incomes must be realistic in view of the site's location. Evidence of such realism typically would include some mix of incomes of other households located in the same census tract or neighborhood, or unique advantages of the public housing site.",
            "(2) For purposes of judging appropriateness of density reduction and broader range of income measures, overall size of the public housing site and its number of dwelling units will be considered. The concerns these measures would address generally are greater as the site's size and number of dwelling units increase."

Requests made by individuals for records about themselves under the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, are processed in accordance with 24 CFR part 2003 as well as this part. Requests for documents made by subpoena or other demands of courts or other authorities are governed by procedures contained in part 2004 of this chapter. These rules should be read in conjunction with the text of the FOIA and the Uniform Freedom of Information Fee Schedule and Guidelines published by the Office of Management and Budget.

A request may also be made by submitting the written request to The Office of Inspector General; Department of Housing and Urban Development; 451 Seventh Street SW, Suite 8260, Washington, DC 20410. The envelope should indicate it is a FOIA request. A request for OIG records may also be made in person during normal business hours at any office where OIG employees are permanently stationed.",
            "(b) Each request must reasonably describe the desired record, including the title or name, author, subject matter, and number or date, where possible, so that the record may be identified and located. The more specific the FOIA request for records, the more likely OIG officials will be able to locate the records requested. The request should also include the name, address and telephone number of the requester, the fee category that the requester believes applies to the request, and the form or format in which the requester would like the desired record to be reproduced, if the requester has a preference. In order to enable the OIG to comply with the time limitations set forth in \u00a7 2002.15, both the envelope containing a written request and the letter itself should clearly indicate that the subject is a Freedom of Information Act request.",
            "(c) The request must be accompanied by the fee or an offer to pay the fee as determined in \u00a7 15.106 of this title and \u00a7 2002.13.",
            "(d) The OIG may require information verifying the requester's identity, if the requester requests agency records pertaining to the requester, a minor, or an individual who is legally incompetent. Failure to provide the information when requested will result in the request being found insufficient and closed. It will not prevent the future refiling of the request.",
            "(e) Duplication of available records will be made as promptly as possible. Such duplication can take the form of paper copy, audiovisual materials, or machine-readable documentation (e.g., electronic documents on CD, DVD, flash drive, etc.). Records that are published or available for sale will not be reproduced.",
            "(f) The OIG shall honor a requester's specified preference of form or format of disclosure if the record is readily reproducible with reasonable efforts in the requested form or format by the office responding to the request.",
            "(g) If the requester makes a request for expedited processing, the request must provide a detailed explanation of the basis for the request. The requester should also include a statement certifying the truth of the circumstances supporting the requester's compelling need. Requests for expedited processing that simply recite the statutory language are generally not granted."

Requests for \u201call\u201d specified records over a span of time, if they are accepted as reasonably describing a specific group of records, are considered complex requests and usually qualify as an unusual circumstance under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)(iii), taking longer than 20 working days to process. Requesters who make requests qualifying as unusual circumstances will be offered an opportunity to narrow the scope of their request or arrange for an alternative time period.",

To aid the requester, the OIG shall make available its FOIA Public Liaison, who shall assist in the resolution of any disputes between the requester and the OIG, and notify the requester of the right of the requester to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services.

            "(b) Denying requests generally. The OIG shall withhold information only if the OIG reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption as provided in this section, or disclosure is prohibited by law. The OIG will consider whether partial disclosure of information is possible whenever the OIG determines that a full disclosure of a requested record is not possible and will take reasonable steps necessary to segregate and release nonexempt information. Nothing in this section requires disclosure of information that is otherwise prohibited from disclosure by law or otherwise exempted from disclosure as provided in this section.",
            "(c) FOIA exemptions. The FOIA contains nine exemptions (5 U.S.C. 552(b)) that authorize agencies to withhold various records from disclosure, and two exclusions to the statute that may be used by the OIG. With regard to the records normally requested, the OIG generally applies the exemptions and exclusions as follows:",
            "(1) Classified documents. Exemption 1 (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(1)) protects classified national defense and foreign relations information. The OIG seldom relies on this exception to withhold documents. However, where applicable, the OIG will refer a request for records classified under Executive Order 13526 and the pertinent records to the originating agency for processing. The OIG may refuse to confirm or deny the existence of the requested information if the originating agency determines that the fact of the existence of the information itself is classified.",
            "(2) Internal agency rules and practices. Exemption 2 (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(2)) protects records relating to internal personnel rules and practices.",
            "(3) Information prohibited from disclosure by another statute. Exemption 3 (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(3)) protects information that is prohibited from disclosure by another Federal law. Some investigative records contain information that could reveal grand jury proceedings, which are protected from disclosure by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e). Section 7 of the Inspector General Act of 1978 prohibits the OIG from disclosing the identity of employees who make protected disclosures. The OIG generally will not disclose competitive proposals prior to contract award, competitive proposals that are not set forth or incorporated by reference into the awarded contract, (see 41 U.S.C. 4702), or, during the selection process, any covered selection information regarding such selection, either directly or indirectly (see 42 U.S.C. 3537a).",
            "(4) Commercial or financial information. Exemption 4 (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4)) protects trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person that is privileged and confidential. The OIG frequently obtains this information through its audits. The OIG will process the release of this category of information pursuant to Executive Order 12600 and give notice to the affected business and an opportunity for the business to present evidence of its confidentiality claim. If the OIG is sued by a requester under the FOIA for nondisclosure of confidential business information, the OIG expects the affected business to cooperate to the fullest extent possible in defending such a decision.",
            "(5) Certain interagency or intra-agency communications. Exemption 5 (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(5)) protects interagency or intra-agency communications that are protected by legal privileges, such as the attorney-client privilege, attorney work-product privilege, or communications reflecting the agency's deliberative process. These communications may include communications with the Department of Justice and with HUD. The deliberative process privilege shall not apply to records created 25 years or more before the date on which the records were requested.",
            "(6) Personal privacy. Exemption 6 (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(6)) protects information involving matters of personal privacy. This information may be found in personnel, medical, and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. Names, addresses, telephone numbers, and email addresses of persons identified in audits or complaints generally will not be disclosed. The OIG has learned through experience that some of its employees (i.e. Hotline employees) will be harassed if their identities are known, and the OIG will protect the identities of these employees. As a law enforcement agency, the OIG finds individuals generally have a heightened privacy interest for not having their identities associated with the OIG.",
            "(7) Law enforcement records. Exemption 7 (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7)) protects certain records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes. This exemption protects records where the production could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings. The protection of this exemption also encompasses, but is not limited to, information in law enforcement files that could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; the names of confidential informants; and techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations, or guidelines for law enforcement investigations if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law. It is the policy of the OIG in responding to all FOIA requests for investigative records pertaining to specifically named individuals to refuse to confirm or deny the existence of such records. Lacking the subject individuals consent, proof of death, an official acknowledgement of an investigation, or an overriding public interest, even to acknowledge the existence of such records could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.",
            "(8) Supervision of financial institutions. Exemption 8 (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(8)) protects information relating to the supervision of financial institutions. It is unlikely that the OIG will have these documents.",
            "(9) Wells. Exemption 9 (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(9)) protects geological information on wells. It is unlikely that the OIG will have these documents.",
            "(d) FOIA exclusion. Some law enforcement records are excluded from the FOIA. 5 U.S.C. 552(c)(1) permits a law enforcement agency to exclude a document from the FOIA if there is reason to believe that:",
            "(1) The subject of the investigation or proceeding is not aware of its pendency; and",
            "(2) Disclosure of the existence of the records could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings, in which case the agency may, during only such time as that circumstance continues, treat the records as not subject to the requirements of the FOIA. Section 552(c)(2) of FOIA allows the exclusion of informant records, unless the existence of the informant has been officially confirmed."

In order to enable the OIG to comply with the time limitations set forth in \u00a7 2002.17, both the envelope containing the request for review and the letter itself should clearly indicate that the subject is a Freedom of Information Act request for review. Each request for review must contain the following:",

            "(2) A copy of the written denial; and",

The OIG will make a determination on all other appeals within 20 working days of receipt, unless unusual circumstances require the OIG to extend the time for an additional 10 working days.",

If a request is misdirected by the requester and is received by one other than the Inspector General, the OIG official who receives the request will forward it promptly to the Inspector General and will advise the requester about the delayed time of receipt.",

            "(f) Adverse decisions will include the name and contact information of dispute resolution services that offer mediation services to resolve disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a nonexclusive alternative to litigation."

            "(a) General statement. The Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation (referred to in this part as the Corporation) was established by Congress in the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation Act (title VI of the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1978, Pub. L. 95-557, October 31, 1978). The Corporation is not a department, agency, or instrumentality of the Federal Government.",
            "(b) The Corporation is authorized to receive and expend Federal appropriations and other public and private revenues to conduct a variety of programs designed primarily to revitalize older urban neighborhoods by mobilizing public, private, and community resources at the neighborhood level. These programs include:",
            "(1) Neighborhood Housing Services. The major effort of the Corporation is to assist local communities in the development, expansion and provision of technical services to local Neighborhood Housing Services (NHS) programs. NHS programs are based upon partnerships of community residents, and representatives of local governments and financial institutions. Each local program is administered by an autonomous, private, non-profit corporation, and conducts a comprehensive revitalization effort in locally selected neighborhoods. Services to neighborhood residents include rehabilitation counseling, construction assistance, financial counseling, loan referrals and loans at flexible rates and terms to homeowners who do not meet private lending criteria. Programs and strategies to remove blighting influences, obtain improved public services and amenities, and improve the neighborhood's image and the functioning of its real estate market are also undertaken. To insure the continuing effectiveness of NHS programs, the Corporation provides grants, training, information and technical services to NHS programs.'",
            "(2) Mutual Housing Associations. The Corporation also supports the organizational development of, and provides technical assistance to, Mutual Housing Associations. Mutual Housing Associations are private, nonprofit organizations which own, manage and continually develop affordable housing. Mutual Housing residents are members of the Association which owns and manages their buildings; thus they enjoy the security of long-term housing tenure. Mutual Housing developments are capitalized through up-front grants and mortgages in a combination that ensures permanent affordability to low- and moderate-income families. Monthly housing charges to residents are kept at affordable levels on a continuing basis. A key element of Mutual Housing is the Association's commitment to use all resources in excess of operating and maintenance costs for the production of additional units. A Mutual Housing Association's board of directors includes current member-residents, potential residents, and representatives from the community, local government and business. Residents and community members make up the majority on the board. A highly qualified professional staff, employed by the Mutual Housing Association, carries out the day-to-day activities of the organization. In addition to creating new affordable housing opportunities, Mutual Housing Associations offer a creative alternative for subsidized rental housing developments whose subsidies are scheduled to expire.",
            "(3) Neighborhood preservation projects. The Corporation identifies, monitors, evaluates and supports through demonstration grants and technical assistance other promising neighborhood preservation strategies based on local, public-private partnerships.",
            "(4) Programmatic supplements. Proven, replicable programmatic tools are offered as broadly as resources permit. Often, these selected strategies are supported by Neighborhood Reinvestment grants. The Corporation's major programmatic supplements include the following:",
            "(i) Neighborhood economic development and commercial revitalization strategies. The Corporation's neighborhood economic development and commercial revitalization strategies offer NHSs a variety of tools designed to stabilize and enhance the economic base of NHS neighborhoods. They complement NHSs' revitalization mission by focusing the energies and resources of the partnership on the economic issues underlying neighborhood decline. Neighborhood economic development and commercial revitalization assures a viable neighborhood economy by strengthening small businesses and improving the physical environment of the area, thus providing additional goods, services, and employment opportunities for the community.",
            "(ii) Housing Development Strategies. The Corporation's Housing Development Strategies program addresses the shortage of affordable, quality housing available to low to moderate income families in NHS neighborhoods, as well as the blighting effect of vacant lots and substandard properties. Home ownership opportunities are created through the planning and implementation of a variety of housing mechanisms by the NHS, which are intended to reverse negative real estate market trends, enhance new residential growth, and create renewed neighborhood pride. The mechanisms being used to achieve these goals include the following.",
            "(A) The Owner Built Housing program is a supervised housing construction process that helps moderate-income homeowners to collectively build their own homes. The NHS provides technical assistance while private lenders and public bodies providing financing.",
            "(B) The Owner Rehab Housing program assists low to moderate income families in collectively rehabilitating existing blighted and vacant structures.",
            "(C) The Infill Housing program provides a mechanism for assisting NHSs in building new units on vacant land to meet the needs of prospective lower income homeowners.",
            "(D) The Urban Subdivisions program focuses on providing low cost, new housing for low-to-moderate income families on tracts of land suitable for the construction of 20 or more units.",
            "(iii) Problem properties strategies. This program assists NHSs in addressing specific problem areas beyond the scope of basic NHS services and typical financial resources. Through the implementation of various problem properties strategies, NHS programs are able to assist tenants to purchase, improve the physical condition of target blocks, eliminate vacant neighborhood eyesores, develop housing and service facilities for special populations, and stimulate private reinvestment and new conventional mortgages in the NHS community.",
            "(5) Apartment Improvement Program. The goal of the Apartment Improvement Program is to provide an effective, economical means of revitalizing and preserving neighborhoods with multi-family housing for the benefit of the current residents. The program is based upon a partnership of tenants and community representatives, property owners and managers, financial institutions and local government. The program assists in the development of an individually tailored improvement plan of activities from which each building may benefit, including tenant participation, tax assessment reviews, and increased investment or restructured mortgages to improve the economic viability of the buildings and to finance improvements.",
            "(6) Neighborhood Housing Services of America. The Corporation also supports Neighborhood Housing Services of America (NHSA), an independent, private, non-profit corporation which provides a variety of services to local NHS programs, including a secondary market for NHS revolving loan fund loans, and the strengthening of private sector resources available to the network of local NHSs."

            "(2) The Board holds an Annual Meeting each year during the month of May (or as the Bylaws or the Board may specify). The Board also holds regular meetings at least quarterly and special meetings as required. The meetings of the Board are conducted in accordance with provisions of the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation Act, the Government in the Sunshine Act (5 U.S.C. 552b), the Corporation's Bylaws, and when not inconsistent with the foregoing, with Robert's Rules of Order.

Consistent with this responsibility, the Secretary of the Corporation provides to the Communications Department at the principal office of the Corporation such records as the Act requires to be made available to the public for access during regular office hours on regular business days.",

The Board elects the officers of the Corporation annually.",
            "(2) The Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation Act provides that the Executive Director shall serve as the chief executive officer of the Corporation. Consistent with that authority, the Corporation's Bylaws provide that the Executive Director shall have the responsibility and authority for the day-to-day administration of the affairs of the Corporation under the general supervision of the Board. The Board periodically reviews the activities of the Executive Director and, from time to time, provides guidance and policy direction to the Executive Director in the exercise of his or her authority.",
            "(3) The responsibilities and authorities of the other officers of the Corporation are set forth in the Corporation's Bylaws, resolutions and policies adopted by the Board, duties and authorities delegated to each officer, other statutes and this statement.

Records are available for public inspection and copying during regular business hours on regular business days at the address stated in paragraph (a) of this section. Requests for records should be submitted in writing and state the full name and address of the person requesting the records and a description of the records or other information sought that is reasonably sufficient to permit their identification without undue difficulty. A request should be submitted sufficiently in advance of the date inspection or copying is desired, preferably by mail.",
            "(2) Although the Corporation finds that the publication of indexes of statements of policy and interpretations or administrative staff manuals and instructions would be unnecessary and impracticable, such information will be made available upon request.",
            "(d) Fees for providing copies for records. Fees shall be assessed pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) in order to recover the full allowable direct costs of providing copies of records. For purposes of this section, the term direct costs means those expenditures which the Corporation actually incurs in searching for and duplicating (and in the case of commercial use requesters, reviewing) documents to respond to a Freedom of Information Act (\u201cFOIA\u201d) request. Direct costs include, for example, the salaries of the employees performing the work (the basic rate of pay plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating duplicating equipment. The term search includes all time spent looking for material that is responsive to a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line identification of material within documents. Searches may be done manually or by computer using existing programming. The term duplication refers to the process of making a copy of a document necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Such copies can take the form of paper copy, microfilm, audiovisual materials, or machine readable documentation (e.g., magnetic tape or disk), among others. The term review refers to the process of examining documents located in response to a commercial use request to determine whether any portion of any document is permitted to be withheld. It also includes processing any documents for disclosure, e.g., doing all that is necessary to exise them and otherwise prepare them for release. Review does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions. A schedule based on these principles is set forth in paragraph (d)(9) of this section.",
            "(1) Categories of requesters. Fees will be assessed according to the category of the requester. There are four categories:",
            "(i) Commercial use requesters. For purposes of this section, the term commercial use request refers to a request from or on behalf of one who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or the person on whose behalf the request is made. In determining whether a requester properly belongs in this category, the Corporation will look to the use to which the requester will put the documents requested. If the use is not clear from the request itself, or if there is reasonable cause to doubt the requester's stated use, the Corporation shall seek additional clarification before assigning the request to a specific category.",
            "(ii) Educational and noncommercial scientific institution requesters. For purposes of this section, the term educational institution refers to a preschool, a public or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of graduate higher education, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an institution of professional education, or an institution of vocational education, which operates a program or programs of scholarly research. The term noncommercial scientific institution refers to an institution that is not operated on a commercial basis, as that term is used in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, and which is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. To be eligible for inclusion in this category, requesters must show that the request is made as authorized by and under the auspices of a qualifying institution, and that the records are not sought for a commercial use, but are sought in furtherance of scholarly (if the request is from an educational institution) or scientific (if the request is from a noncommercial scientific institution) research.",
            "(iii) Requesters who are representatives of the news media. For purposes of this section, the term representative of the news media refers to any person actively gathering information for an entity that is organized and operated to publish or broadcast news to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large, and publishers of periodicals (but only in those instances when they can qualify as disseminators of news) who make their products available for purchase or subscription by the general public. These examples are not intended to be all-inclusive. In the case of freelance journalists, they may be regarded as working for a news organization if they demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that organization, even though not actually employed by it. A publication contract would be the clearest proof, but the Corporation may also look at the past publication record of a requester in making this determination. To be eligible for inclusion in this category, a requester must meet the criteria above, and his or her request must not be made for a commercial use. In reference to this class of requester, a request for records supporting the news dissemination function of the requester shall not be considered to be a request that is for a commercial use.",
            "(iv) All other requesters.",
            "(2) Limitations on fees to be charged\u2014(i) Commercial use requesters. Commercial use requesters shall be assessed the full direct costs for searching for, reviewing, and duplicating records, in accordance with the fee schedule at paragraph (d)(9) of this section. Commercial use requesters are not entitled to the free search time or free pages of duplication provided to other categories of requesters.",
            "(ii) Educational and noncommercial scientific institution requesters. Requesters in this category may be assessed fees only for duplication of records in excess of the first 100 pages. Requesters in this category may not be assessed fees for search or review.",
            "(iii) Requesters who are representatives of the news media. Requesters in this category may be assessed fees only for duplication of records in excess of the first 100 pages. Requesters in this category may not be assessed fees for research or review.",
            "(iv) All other requesters. Requesters who do not fit into any of the categories above shall be assessed fees only for searching and duplicating records, except that the first 100 pages of duplication and the first two hours of search time shall be furnished without charge. Requesters in this category may not be assessed fees for review.",
            "(v) Review of records. Charges will be assessed only for the initial review of the located documents and not for time spent at the administrative appeal level on an exemption applied at the initial determination level. However, where records or portions of records are withheld in full under an exemption which is subsequently determined not to apply, and these records are reviewed again to determine the applicability of other exemptions not previously considered, charges for review are properly assessable.",
            "(vi) Additional copies. The Corporation will normally furnish only one copy of any record. The allowance of 100 free pages of duplication under paragraphs (d)(2) (ii), (iii), and (iv) of this section shall not apply to additional copies furnished at the request of the record requester. Full duplication fees shall be assessed for each page of each such additional copy.",
            "(3) Charges for unsuccessful search. Where applicable under paragraph (d)(2) of this section search fees may be assessed for time spent searching, even if the Corporation fails to locate the records or if records located are determined to be exempt from disclosure.",
            "(4) Notice of anticipated fees in excess of $25.00. Unless the person making the request states in his or her initial request that he or she will pay all costs regardless of amount, the Corporation will notify him or her as soon as possible if there is reason to believe that the cost for obtaining access to and/or copies of such records will exceed $25. If such notice is given, the time limitations contained in the Freedom of Information Act shall not commence until the person making the intitial request agrees in writing to pay such cost.",
            "(5) Advance payments. The Communications Director is authorized to require an advance payment of an amount up to the full estimated charges whenever he or she determines that:",
            "(i) The allowable charges that a requester may be required to pay are likely to exceed $250 and the requester has no history of payment and cannot provide satisfactory assurance that payment will be made; or",
            "(ii) A requester has previously failed to pay a fee charged in a timely manner.",
            "(6) Charging interest. The Corporation will assess interest charges on any unpaid fees starting on the 31st day following the day on which the billing for fees was sent to the requester. Interest will be at the rate prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and will accrue from the date of the billing. Receipt of the fee by the Corporation, even if not processed, will stay the accrual of interest. Interest is not chargeable for unpaid advance payments under paragraph (d)(5) of this section.",
            "(7) Aggregating requests. A requester may not file multiple requests at the same time, each seeking portions of the document or documents, solely in order to avoid payment of fees. When the Corporation reasonably believes that a requester, or a group of requesters acting in concert, is attempting to break a request down into a series of requests for the purpose of evading the assessment of fees, the Corporation may aggregate any such requests and charge accordingly.",
            "(8) Waiver or reduction of fee. The Corporation will furnish documents without charge or at a reduced charge when it is determined that disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the Corporation and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. In making a request for a waiver or reduction of fees, a requester should include a clear statement of his or her interest in the requested documents: The proposed use for the documents and whether the requester will derive income or other benefit from such use; and a statement of how the public will benefit from such use. Determinations concerning waiver or reduction of fees shall be made by the Executive Director, or his or her designee.",
            "(9) Schedule of fees. Fees for searching for, reviewing, duplicating, and providing records and information of the Corporation under this section will be assessed in accordance with the following schedule:",
            "(i) Manual search. For each quarter hour or fraction thereof: $3.37.",
            "(ii) Computer search. For each quarter hour or fraction thereof: $3.37.",
            "(iii) Review. For each quarter hour or fraction thereof: $4.87.",
            "(iv) Duplication.",
            "(A) For a paper photocopy of an existing paper record, $.10 per page.",
            "(B) For duplication of records other than existing paper records (such as computer-stored information, audio or video tapes, microfiche or microfilm), the fee shall equal the actual direct cost of production and duplication of the records or information in a form that is reasonably usable by the requester.",
            "(10) Processing costs. The Communications Director will waive payment in instances in which the costs of routine collection and processing of the fee are likely to equal or exceed the amount of the fee."
