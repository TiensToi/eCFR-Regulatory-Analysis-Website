In periodically reviewing whether the existence of private cabin sites conflicts with the best public use of an area, consideration shall be given to (i) existing and projected public need for the area, (ii) compatibility between public uses and private cabin sites, (iii) development potential and plans for the area, and (iv) other relevant factors.",

These determinations and the reasons therefor shall be published in the Federal Register, together with such other forms of public notice as may be appropriate and necessary as determined by the Authorized Officer.",
            "(3) Except as otherwise provided in an existing permit, no substantial improvement may hereafter be placed on any cabin site under permit without the prior approval of the Authorized Officer, and on such terms as the Authorized Officer may provide, consistent with public need. All renewed or extended permits shall contain this provision. Any such provision shall expressly state that the permission to place a substantial improvement on the site is a limited license subject to public need for the area and does not give the owner of the improvement any interest in the land or any special rights or equities, other than the right to remove the improvement at any time, subject to the land being left in reasonably unimpaired condition. This provision shall expressly stipulate that the owner shall have as a time period within which to amortize his investment in a substantial improvement placed on the site after the date of the regulations in this part, only the period of his existing permit, together with such extensions of his permit as may be granted consistent with the regulations in this part.",

Thus, for example, if a permit for the site is purchased before the effective date of the regulations in this part with the substantial improvement then in place, for a consideration of $1,000 or more, such amortization period runs from the purchase date, and is not affected, in any event, by the date of the determination under paragraph (a) of this section. The amortization period for any investment in a substantial improvement on or after the effective date of the regulations in this part is covered by paragraph (a)(3) of this section, this paragraph (b), and paragraph (b)(5) of this section.",

            "(3) Any renewal or extension of a permit shall expressly state its termination date and that there will be no extension or renewal thereafter, except as provided by this part. Permits shall expressly state that they grant no vested property right but afford only a limited license to occupy the land, pending a greater public use.",
            "(4) Upon termination of occupancy under a permit, its renewal or extension, the permittee shall remove his improvements from the site within 90 days from the date of termination, and the land shall be left in reasonably unimpaired condition and as near to its original undisturbed condition as possible. Any property not so removed shall become the property of the United States or may be moved off the site, at the cost of the permittee. Any renewal, or extension, of a permit shall state these requirements.",

No such transfer shall operate to extend the terms of a permit. A transfer after the effective date of the regulations in this part shall give the transferee no rights in addition to those which the transferor had. Where any transfer of a cabin site permit is approved, the approval shall state in writing the requirements of this paragraph, and include the statement that the amortization period for any substantial improvement located on the site shall be limited to the period to which the transferor would have been entitled under the regulations in this part.",
            "(6) Nonuse of a site for a period of more than 2 consecutive calendar years shall terminate the permit without right of renewal (subject to the specific terms of the permit): Provided, however, That where the nonuse is the result of the death, illness, or military service of the permittee the Authorized Officer may waive such nonuse. In such case, sale or transfer of the improvement may be made for the unexpired portion of the permit and subject to the provisions for amortization set forth in this section. The Authorized Officer may make exceptions to this termination provision in any case where he determines that the needs of the general public so require (see introductory text of this paragraph (b)).

            "(a) In 1970, the Secretary of the Interior developed a policy statement on intergovernmental cooperation in the preservation, use and management of fish and wildlife resources. The purpose of the policy (36 FR 21034, Nov. 3, 1971) was to strengthen and support the missions of the several States and the Department of the Interior respecting fish and wildlife. Since development of the policy, a number of Congressional enactments and court decisions have addressed State and Federal responsibilities for fish and wildlife with the general effect of expanding Federal jurisdiction over certain species and uses of fish and wildlife traditionally managed by the States. In some cases, this expansion of jurisdiction has established overlapping authorities, clouded agency jurisdictions and, due to differing agency interpretations and accountabilities, has contributed to confusion and delays in the implementation of management programs. Nevertheless, Federal authority exists for specified purposes while State authority regarding fish and resident wildlife remains the comprehensive backdrop applicable in the absence of specific, overriding Federal law.",
            "(b) The Secretary of the Interior reaffirms that fish and wildlife must be maintained for their ecological, cultural, educational, historical, aesthetic, scientific, recreational, economic, and social values to the people of the United States, and that these resources are held in public trust by the Federal and State governments for the benefit of present and future generations of Americans. Because fish and wildlife are fundamentally dependent upon habitats on private and public lands managed or subject to administration by many Federal and State agencies, and because provisions for the protection, maintenance and enhancement of fish and wildlife and the regulation for their use are established in many laws and regulations involving a multitude of Federal and State administrative structures, the effective stewardship of fish and wildlife requires the cooperation of the several States and the Federal Government.",
            "(c) It is the intent of the Secretary to strengthen and support, to the maximum legal extent possible, the missions of the States \n1\n and the Department of the Interior to conserve and manage effectively the nation's fish and wildlife. It is, therefore, important that a Department of the Interior Fish and Wildlife Policy be implemented to coordinate and facilitate the efforts of Federal and State agencies in the attainment of this objective."

This policy is intended to reaffirm the basic role of the States in fish and resident wildlife management, especially where States have primary authority and responsibility, and to foster improved conservation of fish and wildlife.",
            "(b) In developing and implementing this policy, this Department will be furthering the manifest Congressional policy of Federal-State cooperation that pervades statutory enactments in the area of fish and wildlife conservation. Moreover, in recognition of the scope of its activities in managing hundreds of millions of acres of land within the several States, the Department of the Interior will continue to seek new opportunities to foster a \u201cgood neighbor\u201d policy with the States."

          "paragraphs": [
            "(a) In general the States possess broad trustee and police powers over fish and wildlife within their borders, including fish and wildlife found on Federal lands within a State. Under the Property Clause of the Constitution, Congress is given the power to \u201cmake all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States.\u201d In the exercise of power under the Property Clause, Congress may choose to preempt State management of fish and wildlife on Federal lands and, in circumstances where the exercise of power under the Commerce Clause is available, Congress may choose to establish restrictions on the taking of fish and wildlife whether or not the activity occurs on Federal lands, as well as to establish restrictions on possessing, transporting, importing, or exporting fish and wildlife. Finally, a third source of Federal constitutional authority for the management of fish and wildlife is the treaty making power. This authority was first recognized in the negotiation of a migratory bird treaty with Great Britain on behalf of Canada in 1916.",
            "(b) The exercise of Congressional power through the enactment of Federal fish and wildlife conservation statutes has generally been associated with the establishment of regulations more restrictive than those of State law. The power of Congress respecting the taking of fish and wildlife has been exercised as a restrictive regulatory power, except in those situations where the taking of these resources is necessary to protect Federal property. With these exceptions, and despite the existence of constitutional power respecting fish and wildlife on Federally owned lands, Congress has, in fact, reaffirmed the basic responsibility and authority of the States to manage fish and resident wildlife on Federal lands.",
            "(c) Congress has charged the Secretary of the Interior with responsibilities for the management of certain fish and wildlife resources, e.g., endangered and threatened species, migratory birds, certain marine mammals, and certain aspects of the management of some anadromous fish. However, even in these specific instances, with the limited exception of marine mammals, State jurisdiction remains concurrent with Federal authority."

          "heading": "\u00a7 24.4   Resource management and public activities on Federal lands.",
          "paragraphs": [
            "(a) The four major systems of Federal lands administered by the Department of the Interior are lands administered by the Bureau of Reclamation, Bureau of Land Management, units of the National Wildlife Refuge System and national fish hatcheries, and units of the National Park System.",
            "(b) The Bureau of Reclamation withdraws public lands and acquires non-Federal lands for construction and operation of water resource development projects within the 17 Western States. Recreation and conservation or enhancement of fish and wildlife resources are often designated project purposes. General authority for Reclamation to modify project structures, develop facilities, and acquire lands to accommodate fish and wildlife resources is given to the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act of 1946, as amended (16 U.S.C. 661-667e). That act further provides that the lands, waters and facilities designated for fish and wildlife management purposes, in most instances, should be made available by cooperative agreement to the agency exercising the administration of these resources of the particular State involved. The Federal Water Project Recreation Act of 1965, as amended, also directs Reclamation to encourage non-Federal public bodies to administer project land and water areas for recreation and fish and wildlife enhancement. Reclamation withdrawal, however, does not enlarge the power of the United States with respect to management of fish and resident wildlife and, except for activities specified in Section III.3 above, basic authority and responsibility for management of fish and resident wildlife on such lands remains with the State.",
            "(c) BLM-administered lands comprise in excess of 300 million acres that support significant and diverse populations of fish and wildlife. Congress in the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) directed that non-wilderness BLM lands be managed by the Secretary under principles of multiple use and sustained yield, and for both wilderness and non-wilderness lands explicitly recognized and reaffirmed the primary authority and responsibility of the States for management of fish and resident wildlife on such lands. Concomitantly, the Secretary of the Interior is charged with the responsibility to manage non-wilderness BLM lands for multiple uses, including fish and wildlife conservation. However, this authority to manage lands for fish and wildlife values is not a preemption of State jurisdiction over fish and wildlife. In exercising this responsibility the Secretary is empowered to close areas to hunting, fishing or trapping for specified reasons viz., public safety, administration, or compliance with provisions of applicable law. The closure authority of the Secretary is thus a power to close areas to particular activities for particular reasons and does not in and of itself constitute a grant of authority to the Secretary to manage wildlife or require or authorize the issuance of hunting and/or fishing permits or licenses.",
            "(d) While the several States therefore possess primary authority and responsibility for management of fish and resident wildlife on Bureau of Land Management lands, the Secretary, through the Bureau of Land Management, has custody of the land itself and the habitat upon which fish and resident wildlife are dependent. Management of the habitat is a responsibility of the Federal Government. Nevertheless, Congress in the Sikes Act has directed the Secretary of the Interior to cooperate with the States in developing programs on certain public lands, including those administered by BLM and the Department of Defense, for the conservation and rehabilitation of fish and wildlife including specific habitat improvement projects.",
            "(e) Units of the National Wildlife Refuge System occur in nearly every State and constitute Federally owned or controlled areas set aside primarily as conservation areas for migratory waterfowl and other species of fish or wildlife. Units of the system also provide outdoor enjoyment for millions of visitors annually for the purpose of hunting, fishing and wildlife-associated recreation. In 1962 and 1966, Congress authorized the use of National Wildlife Refuges for outdoor recreation provided that it is compatible with the primary purposes for which the particular refuge was established. In contrast to multiple use public lands, the conservation, enhancement and perpetuation of fish and wildlife is almost invariably the principal reason for the establishment of a unit of the National Wildlife Refuge System. In consequence, Federal activity respecting management of migratory waterfowl and other wildlife residing on units of the National Wildlife Refuge System involves a Federal function specifically authorized by Congress. It is therefore for the Secretary to determine whether units of the System shall be open to public uses, such as hunting and fishing, and on what terms such access shall be granted. However, in recognition of the existing jurisdictional relationship between the States and the Federal Government, Congress, in the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966 (16 U.S.C. 668dd), has explicitly stated that nothing therein shall be construed as affecting the authority of the several States to manage fish and resident wildlife found on units of the system. Thus, Congress has directed that, to the maximum extent practicable, such public uses shall be consistent with State laws and regulations. Units of the National Wildlife Refuge System, therefore, shall be managed, to the extent practicable and compatible with the purposes for which they were established, in accordance with State laws and regulations, comprehensive plans for fish and wildlife developed by the States, and Regional Resource Plans developed by the Fish and Wildlife Service in cooperation with the States.",
            "(f) Units of the National Park System contain natural, recreation, historic, and cultural values of national significance as designated by Executive and Congressional action. Specific enabling legislation has authorized limited hunting, trapping or fishing activity within certain areas of the system. As a general rule, consumptive resource utilization is prohibited. Those areas which do legislatively allow hunting, trapping, or fishing, do so in conformance with applicable Federal and State laws. The Superintendent may, in consultation with the appropriate State agency, fix times and locations where such activities will be prohibited. Areas of the National Park System which permit fishing generally will do so in accordance with applicable State and Federal Laws.",
            "(g) In areas of exclusive Federal jurisdiction, State laws are not applicable. However, every attempt shall be made to consult with the appropriate States to minimize conflicting and confusing regulations which may cause undue hardship.",
            "(h) The management of habitat for species of wildlife, populations of wildlife, or individual members of a population shall be in accordance with a Park Service approved Resource Management Plan. The appropriate States shall be consulted prior to the approval of management actions, and memoranda of understanding shall be executed as appropriate to ensure the conduct of programs which meet mutual objectives.",
            "(i) Federal agencies of the Department of the Interior shall:",
            "(1) Prepare fish and wildlife management plans in cooperation with State fish and wildlife agencies and other Federal (non-Interior) agencies where appropriate. Where such plans are prepared for Federal lands adjoining State or private lands, the agencies shall consult with the State or private landowners to coordinate management objectives;",
            "(2) Within their statutory authority and subject to the management priorities and strategies of such agencies, institute fish and wildlife habitat management practices in cooperation with the States to assist the States in accomplishing their fish and wildlife resource plans;",
            "(3) Provide for public use of Federal lands in accordance with State and Federal laws, and permit public hunting, fishing and trapping within statutory and budgetary limitations and in a manner compatible with the primary objectives for which the lands are administered. The hunting, fishing, and trapping, and the possession and disposition of fish, game, and fur animals, shall be conducted in all other respects within the framework of applicable State and Federal laws, including requirements for the possession of appropriate State licenses or permits.",
            "(4) For those Federal lands that are already open for hunting, fishing, or trapping, closure authority shall not be exercised without prior consultation with the affected States, except in emergency situations. The Bureau of Land Management may, after consultation with the States, close all or any portion of public land under its jurisdiction to public hunting, fishing, or trapping for reasons of public safety, administration, or compliance with provisions of applicable law. The National Park Service and Fish and Wildlife Service may, after consultation with the States, close all or any portion of Federal land under their jurisdictions, or impose such other restrictions as are deemed necessary, for reasons required by the Federal laws governing the management of their areas; and",

For processing fees, the BLM takes into account the factors in section 304(b) of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA) (43 U.S.C. 1734(b)) before deciding a fee. The BLM considers the factors for each type of document when the processing fee is a fixed fee and for each individual document when the fee is decided on a case-by-case basis, as explained in \u00a7 3000.110.",
            "(b) Conditions for filing. The BLM will not accept a document that the applicant submits without the proper filing or processing fee amounts except for documents where the BLM sets the fee on a case-by-case basis. Fees are not refundable except as provided for case-by-case fees in \u00a7 3000.110. The BLM will keep the fixed filing or processing fee as a service charge even if the BLM does not approve the application or the applicant withdraws it completely or partially.",

The BLM will periodically adjust fees established in this subchapter according to changes in the Implicit Price Deflator for Gross Domestic Product, which is published quarterly by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Because the fee recalculations are simply based on a mathematical formula, the BLM will change the fees in final rules without opportunity for notice and comment.",

            "(2) For a document that the BLM receives on or after June 22, 2024, the applicant must include the required fixed fees with the documents filed, as provided in \u00a7 3000.120(a) of this chapter, and the applicant is subject to case-by-case processing fees as provided in \u00a7 3000.110 and under other provisions of this chapter."

            "(ii) If the fee the applicant would pay under this paragraph (b)(4) is less than the BLM's actual costs as a result of consideration of the FLPMA section 304(b) factors, and the BLM is not able to process the document promptly because of the unavailability of funding or other resources, the applicant will have the option to pay the BLM's actual costs to process the document.",

Payment is due to the BLM 30 days after the applicant receives its bill. The BLM will stop processing the document if the applicant does not pay the bill by the date payment is due.",
            "(ii) If a periodic payment turns out to be more or less than the BLM's reasonable processing costs for the period, the BLM will adjust the next billing accordingly or make a refund. Do not deduct any amount from a payment without the BLM's prior written approval.",
            "(6) The applicant must pay the entire fee before the BLM will issue the final document.",
            "(7) The applicant may appeal the BLM's estimated processing costs in accordance with the regulations in 43 CFR part 4, subpart E. The applicant may also appeal any determination the BLM makes under paragraph (a) of this section that a document designated for a fixed fee will be processed as a case-by-case fee. The BLM will not process the document further until the appeal is resolved, in accordance with paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section, unless the applicant pays the fee under protest while the appeal is pending. If the appeal results in a decision changing the proposed fee, the BLM will adjust the fee in accordance with paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section."

            "While the Act authorizes the Commission to undertake a wide range of general planning and mitigation activities, it also specifies certain projects or groups of projects that the Commission is to implement. The Commission considers these obligations from the Act to be integral components of the mitigation and conservation plan and of the planning process used to develop this plan. From the perspective of the plan, two issues are germane. These are the extent to which these obligations must take priority over other projects, either in terms of funding or sequencing and the extent to which there is flexibility in the specific actions to be taken in fulfillment of these obligations. Through this planning rule and other means the Commission will ensure that interested parties are made aware of the implications of these obligations in order that they might use this information when participating in the development and implementation of the plan.",
            "(a) Description of mitigation obligations. Obligations principally derive from three portions of the Act: Title II, section 304, and section 315. Following is a description of the obligations contained in each.",
            "(1) Title II. Title II authorizes funding and provides guidance for completion of certain features of the Central Utah Project. It also provides for Commission involvement in several specific activities relating to Central Utah Project mitigation, including funding for specific Section 8 mitigation activities. In the future, additional Title II features will be implemented. These will be subject to environmental review through NEPA or other applicable Federal laws and will, in many instances, be coupled with mitigation measures. Section 301(f)(3) of the Act directs that priority be given for funding of mitigation measures that are associated with Central Utah Project features identified in either Title II or III of the Act that have been, or will be, authorized through compliance with NEPA.",
            "(2) Section 304. This section directs that mitigation and conservation projects contained in the DPR be completed and that this be accomplished in accordance with the DPR and the schedule specified in section 315 of the Act. Several elements of the DPR have been either completed or initiated.",
            "(3) Section 315. This section identifies several mitigation and conservation projects that are to be implemented to enhance fish, wildlife, and recreation resources. It also identifies the funds that are to be authorized for each project. Initial phases of selected section 315 projects have already received Commission funding approval. Additional section 315 projects have undergone substantial review and detailed implementation plans have, in some cases, been prepared.",
            "(b) Commission policy on fulfilling obligations. As referenced in \u00a7 10005.5, Section 301(f)(1) and (2) of the Act provides for re-programming of Section 8 funds to other projects in accordance with the plan and/or following appropriate public involvement and agency consultation, and provided \u201cthat the benefits to fish, wildlife, or recreation will be better served\u201d by doing so. The Commission interprets this as giving the Commission broad discretion to determine, with appropriate agency consultation and public involvement, whether to implement projects delineated in the above stated sections and, should the Commission choose to implement these, the form that this implementation will take.",
            "(1) This notwithstanding, the Commission recognizes that the projects referenced in Title II, Section 304, and Section 315 have, in most cases, undergone considerable planning as well as agency and public scrutiny. Their inclusion in the Act represents a consensus among Federal and state agencies, water developers, and the national and state environmental communities that these mitigation measures have merit. Further, NEPA proceedings have, in some instances, been completed.",
            "(2) Absent the plan, the Commission will rely on Title II, Section 304, and Section 315 as the principal guidance in authorizing projects. Once adopted, the plan will become the principal form of guidance. In selecting projects for the plan, mitigation measures referenced in Title II, Section 304, and Section 315 will be given priority consideration. They will, however, be subjected to the same analysis as other proposed projects. Should these projects be found to not meet the Commission's standards for project approval, they will be rejected. Title II, Section 304, and Section 315 projects that meet Commission standards will only be superseded in the plan if it can be demonstrated that the contributions to be made by other projects proposed through the project solicitation process significantly outweigh those of the aforementioned Title II, Section 304, and/or Section 315 projects.",
            "(3) Regardless, the Commission will retain flexibility regarding how Title II, Section 304, and Section 315 projects will be implemented. Interested parties may, if they choose, propose modifications or enhancements to these projects through the normal project solicitation process. The Commission will pay particular attention to proposals that will accomplish Title II, Section 304, or Section 315 measures at lower cost, thereby freeing up funds for heretofore unidentified projects.",
            "(4) The Commission is aware that future NEPA procedures related to the development of Title II features may result in the identification of additional impacts and mitigation measures. The Commission considers implementation of measures that result from a formal NEPA procedure to be non-discretionary. The Commission recognizes a commitment to implement such measures as are within its authority. Further, in accordance with Section 301(f)(3), the Commission is committed to giving these measures high priority. In order to ensure that such measures are consistent with the Commission's overall program, and can be implemented within budget, the Commission will take an active role in NEPA procedures that are likely to result in significant mitigation obligations for the Commission.",
            "(5) If the Commission chooses not to implement a mitigation measure or, for any reason be unable to implement a measure resulting from NEPA procedures, the Commission will conduct, or cause to have conducted, a supplemental environmental evaluation to determine suitable alternative mitigation measures. The Commission will implement the findings of that evaluation to the extent possible. The only exception will be when the Commission proposes to substitute an equivalent mitigation measure that meets with the approval of applicable Federal, State, or Tribal fish and wildlife agencies, the Secretary of the Interior, and other affected parties.",
            "(6) In order to assist agencies and other interested parties in understanding the scope of the obligations contained in Title II, Section 304, and Section 315, and others that may arise in the future, the Commission will, at the time it invites recommendations on measures to be included in the plan, prepare and distribute a list of projects that the Commission considers to be obligations as defined in this section."

For each fiscal year, projects identified in the plan will be arranged into a series of programs based on project type or ecological and geographical associations. These programs will serve as the basis for the agency's budget request.",
            "(c) Once the budget request is formulated and submitted to the Congress, the request may be altered or reformulated by the Congress before the appropriation statute is finally approved. The appropriation statute will then control the implementation of the plan. In light of the controlling nature of the appropriation statute over the implementation of the plan, the plan must maintain sufficient flexibility to allow adjustments to comply with appropriations. The amendment process described in \u00a7 10005.21 provides the mechanism for modifying the plan to correspond to changes in Congressional appropriations. Changes to the annual project portfolio will, in most instances, constitute a \u201csubstantive\u201d amendment as described in \u00a7 10005.21.",

            "Within Utah, several federal agencies, state agencies, and tribal governments have authorities and responsibilities related to the management of fish and wildlife resources, through management of the resource itself, through management of the land and water upon which fish and wildlife depend, or, in the case of Federal reclamation projects, through involvement in mitigation activities. The Act specifically recognizes the authority of other Federal and State agencies to take actions in accordance with other applicable laws. The guidance for this is provided by Section 301(a)(2), which states that \u201cNothing herein is intended to limit or restrict the authorities of Federal, State, or local governments, or political subdivisions thereof, to plan, develop, or implement mitigation, conservation, or enhancement of fish, wildlife, or recreation resources in the State in accordance with applicable provisions of Federal or State law.\u201d In preparing and implementing its plan, it is the Commission's intent to form a cooperative partnership with other agencies having fish, wildlife, and recreation responsibilities and authorities, both recognizing and relying upon their authorities. The Commission recognizes that these agencies may have specific legal obligations to take actions to maintain or restore fish, wildlife, or recreation resources that are independent of Commission mandates. While the Commission will, as appropriate, authorize the use of funds to complement the resource protection and restoration activities of these agencies, Commission involvement should not be viewed as a replacement for funding or other actions that are rightfully the responsibility of another agency.",
            "(a) Agencies with land management authority. The Commission recognizes that the Federal government, the State of Utah, and applicable Indian tribes each own and/or manage lands that are important to fish and wildlife resources and provide significant outdoor recreation opportunities. At the Federal level, the Forest Service manages National Forest System lands, the Fish and Wildlife Service manages national wildlife refuges, the National Park Service manages national parks, monuments, and recreation areas, the Bureau of Reclamation manages reservoirs and lands adjoining those reservoirs, and the Bureau of Land Management manages other public lands. Indian tribes own and manage lands in accordance with treaties between the tribes and the United States Government. The State of Utah owns and manages state parks, wildlife management areas, and public trust lands. The Commission recognizes the importance of federal, tribal, and state lands to fish, wildlife, and recreation and will entertain proposals for mitigation and conservation activities involving these lands when the following conditions are met:",
            "(1) The managing agency concurs with the proposed action,",
            "(2) All appropriate legal procedures have been followed, and",
            "(3) The land management agency is willing to assume long-term responsibility for operation and maintenance of mitigation and conservation features and to refrain from management activities that may negate or significantly diminish the effects of the project on fish, wildlife, or recreation.",
            "(b) Agencies with Federal reclamation project mitigation responsibilities and/or authorities. Several agencies also have direct authorities and responsibilities relating to mitigation for the effects of Federal reclamation projects in Utah. These include the Department of the Interior Central Utah Project Office, the Bureau of Reclamation, the Central Utah Water Conservancy District, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources. The remainder of this section summarizes the authorities and responsibilities of these agencies with regards to Federal reclamation projects, with emphasis on the Commission's relationship to these agencies. This section does not identify or describe all of the potential relationships between the Commission and other agencies with Federal reclamation project mitigation obligations. As appropriate, the Commission may enter into formal agreements with any or all of the above agencies in order to provide additional detail regarding the relationship or to assign specific program or project responsibilities. The arrangements that are described in this section may also be modified through interagency agreement.",
            "(1) Secretary of the Interior's Representative to the Central Utah Project. As required by Section 201(e) of the Act, the Secretary of the Interior is ultimately responsible for carrying out all responsibilities specifically identified in the Act. The Secretary's Representative serves as the Secretary's official representative to the Central Utah Project. The Secretary's Representative monitors activities undertaken in fulfillment of the various aspects of the Act to ensure that these activities, including mitigation activities, are in accordance with applicable law and that Federal funds are used appropriately. The Secretary's Representative also coordinates activities among Department of the Interior agencies involved with the Central Utah Project. The Commission is a Federal Commission within the executive branch of government and its activities are subject to the direct oversight of Congress. While essentially independent of the Secretary of the Interior, the Commission nevertheless has a vital relationship with the Department via both the budget process and the similarity in missions. The Secretary's Representative serves as the principal link between the Commission and the Department of the Interior and is responsible for transmitting Congressional appropriations to fund the Commission's mitigation, conservation, and administrative activities. For purposes of plan development and implementation, the following will guide the Commission's relationship to the Secretary's Representative:",
            "(i) The Commission acknowledges the authority of the Secretary in overseeing implementation of the Act and recognizes that the Secretary's Representative plays an essential role in ensuring the compatibility of mitigation and conservation measures with the overall Central Utah Project. The Commission is committed to a strong and productive partnership with the Secretary's Representative in fulfilling the Commission's mitigation and conservation responsibilities.",
            "(ii) The Commission will maintain close communication with the Secretary's Representative regarding the relationship between the plan and Congressional appropriations. The Commission will provide the Secretary's Representative with both long range and annual funding proposals and otherwise assist in preparing the Commission's budget requests to Congress.",
            "(iii) The Commission and the Secretary's Representative will independently and cooperatively monitor the plan in terms of meeting Section 8 mitigation obligations as directed by the Act.",
            "(iv) The Commission will actively involve the Secretary's Representative in the Commission's NEPA related activities, including the identification of appropriate roles for the Secretary's Representative and Department of the Interior agencies in the preparation and review of NEPA documents.",
            "(v) The Commission will, as appropriate, involve the Secretary's Representative in coordinating Commission mitigation and conservation activities with the Bureau of Indian Affairs and with individual Indian tribes.",
            "(vi) The Commission will utilize the Secretary's Representative as its principal contact for matters regarding the Department of the Interior and, when appropriate, will seek assistance from the Secretary's Representative in coordinating activities involving agencies within the Department, especially when activities involve several agencies. The Commission will, as appropriate, involve the Secretary's Representative in resolving differences that might arise among the various agencies within the Department with regard to the Commission's plan, or the implementation of any measure contained in the plan. This provision does not alter the direct working relationships that the Commission maintains with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Bureau of Reclamation, the Bureau of Land Management, and other applicable agencies.",
            "(2) U.S.D.I. Bureau of Reclamation. Prior to the Act, the Bureau of Reclamation (Bureau) had the responsibility for implementing mitigation measures associated with Federal reclamation projects within the State of Utah. Section 301(a)(1) of the Act granted authority to the Commission \u201cto coordinate the implementation of the mitigation and conservation provisions of this Act.\u201d Section 301(n) further transferred from the Bureau to the Commission \u201cthe responsibility for implementing Section 8 funds for mitigation and conservation projects and features authorized in this Act.\u201d While the Act therefore clearly transfers mitigation responsibilities concerning the Bonneville Unit of the Central Utah Project from the Bureau to the Commission, it does not alter the Bureau's mitigation responsibilities with respect to other components of the Colorado River Storage Project or other Federal reclamation projects in Utah. For purposes of plan development and implementation, the following will guide the Commission's relationship to the Bureau:",
            "(i) The Commission recognizes that the Bureau and the Commission share fish, wildlife, and recreation mitigation responsibilities associated with Federal reclamation projects within the State of Utah and is committed to maintaining a strong and productive partnership with the Bureau in this regard.",
            "(ii) Except for those features that the Secretary has assigned to others in allocating the $214,352,000 increase in CRSP authorization specified in Section 201(a) of the Act, the Commission has the primary authority and responsibility for all mitigation projects involving use of Section 8 funds for the Bonneville Unit and for alternative formulations of the Uintah and Upalco units of the Central Utah Project, and all mitigation projects identified in Section 315 of the Act, or as modified in the plan.",
            "(iii) The Bureau retains the responsibility and primary authority to undertake fish, wildlife, and recreation mitigation and conservation activities for Federal reclamation projects in Utah other than those as described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section wherein the Bureau acts at the direction of the Commission. The Commission also has the authority to undertake selective fish, wildlife, and recreation mitigation and conservation activities concerning these same projects, as authorized in Section 315 of the Act or in the plan. The Commission will actively consult with the Bureau with regard to potential mitigation or enhancement activities in those areas in order to ensure that Bureau and Commission mitigation activities are coordinated.",
            "(iv) The Bureau retains responsibility for implementation of fish, wildlife, and recreation mitigation measures associated with Federal reclamation projects in Utah that were initiated prior to the establishment of the Act where that responsibility has not specifically been transferred to the Commission, a water district, or other entity.",
            "(v) The Bureau retains responsibility for operation, maintenance, and replacement of facilities related to fish, wildlife, and recreation mitigation measures undertaken by the Bureau where that responsibility has not specifically been transferred to the Commission, a water district, or other entity.",
            "(vi) The Bureau retains responsibility for mitigating future impacts to fish, wildlife, and recreation caused by operation, maintenance, and replacement of water resource development facilities where that responsibility has not specifically been transferred to the Commission, a water district, or other entity.",
            "(vii) The Commission has no responsibility or authority for mitigation or replacement measures associated with Federal reclamation projects in Utah that are not related to fish, wildlife, and recreation.",
            "(3) Central Utah Water Conservancy District. The Central Utah Water Conservancy District (District) is responsible for construction, operation, and management of the various features of the Central Utah Project. NEPA compliance regarding many of these features has resulted in the identification of several measures that are to be undertaken as mitigation for the Central Utah Project's impacts to fish, wildlife, and/or recreation. NEPA compliance for future project features is likely to identify additional fish, wildlife, and recreation mitigation and conservation measures. The Act directs that the Commission give funding priority to measures that result from applicable NEPA procedures. The Act does not, however, specify what role the Commission is to have in determining, or planning for, these measures. For purposes of plan development and implementation, the following will guide the Commission's relationship to the District:",
            "(i) The Commission is committed to maintaining a strong and productive partnership with the District in order to adequately plan for and implement mitigation measures associated with the Central Utah Project.",
            "(ii) The Commission recognizes that the District and the Commission have complementary responsibilities for fish, wildlife, and recreation mitigation regarding the Central Utah Project. The District retains the overall responsibility for planning for mitigation activities associated with its completion of the Central Utah Project. The Commission has the responsibility for ensuring that mitigation measures meet with the intent of the Act with regard to protection and restoration of fish, wildlife, and recreation resources and for approving and implementing mitigation and conservation measures. Accordingly, the Commission will monitor District mitigation and conservation planning activities and provide such assistance as is mutually agreed upon.",
            "(iii) The Commission will actively monitor or, as appropriate, participate in NEPA procedures undertaken by the District that may result in the identification of mitigation and conservation measures that, if implemented, would require Commission funding or may affect other mitigation activities of interest to the Commission. For NEPA procedures that are likely to result in significant Commission obligations, the Commission may request \u201cjoint lead agency\u201d status with the District. In such instances the specific involvement of the Commission in the preparation of NEPA documentation will be determined through agreement with the District.",
            "(iv) The District retains responsibility for mitigating future impacts to fish, wildlife, and recreation caused by the operation, maintenance, and replacement of its water resource development facilities, unless that responsibility has been specifically transferred to the Commission or other entity.",
            "(v) The District retains responsibility for operation, maintenance, and, where necessary, replacement of fish, wildlife, and recreation mitigation features managed by the District, unless that responsibility has been specifically transferred to the Commission or other entity.",
            "(4) U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) has mandated responsibility to implement several acts relevant to the Commission's activities. In Section 301(b)(3), the Act specifically references a Commission obligation to comply with the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act (FWCA) and the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Other acts administered by the Service and relevant to Commission activities include, but are not necessarily limited to, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (16 U.S.C. 703 et seq.) and the Bald Eagle Protection Act (16 U.S.C. 668-668d). The FWCA directs that the Service, and the state fish and wildlife agency, must be consulted where the \u201cwaters of any stream or other body of water are proposed or authorized to be impounded, diverted * * * or otherwise controlled or modified * * * by any department or agency of the United States, or by any public or private agency under Federal permit or license. * * *\u201d The purpose of this consultation is to provide for \u201cthe conservation of wildlife resources by preventing loss of and damage to such resources.\u201d The FWCA provides the major mechanism for Service involvement in the Federal reclamation project decision process. The Service's most important role in Federal reclamation projects is in the development and later the monitoring of fish and wildlife mitigation measures. The Service is also responsible for reporting to the Secretary of the Interior on the status of mitigation programs. The Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act provides for the funding of Service FWCA consultation by the agency sponsoring the proposed activity. The Service's ESA responsibilities that are most relevant to Commission activities include listing of new species, preparation and implementation of recovery plans and consultations regarding adverse effects on listed species. Section 7(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act authorizes Federal agencies to carry out programs for the conservation of endangered and threatened species. Participating in, and being consistent with, recovery plans is a fundamental component of this obligation. Section 7(a)(2) of the ESA requires that, prior to taking any action that may affect a listed species, a Federal agency must consult with the Service to ensure that the action will not jeopardize the continued existence of the species or adversely modify critical habitat. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) establishes a Federal role in protecting bird species that generally migrate across national boundaries. In Utah, these include most indigenous bird species. The MBTA is not intended as a substitute for state wildlife management authority but rather as a complement. The Service is responsible for implementing many of the features of the MBTA, and for encouraging states to undertake actions to protect migratory bird species. The Bald Eagle Protection Act prohibits the taking or possession of either bald or golden eagles, both of which commonly inhabit areas near Utah's rivers and wetlands. For purposes of plan development and implementation, the following will guide the Commission's relationship to the Service:",
            "(i) The Commission acknowledges the biological expertise of the Service with regard to Federal reclamation projects and other Commission activities relating to the protection and restoration of fish and wildlife resources and will seek to utilize this expertise to the fullest extent. The Commission further recognizes the similarity in agency missions with regard to fish and wildlife mitigation and conservation and is committed to a strong and productive partnership with the Service in this regard.",
            "(ii) The Commission acknowledges the Service's mandated responsibility with regard to Federal reclamation projects and will specifically consult with the Service regarding activities that are subject to the FWCA. These include both projects directly related to mitigation for Federal water resource projects and applicable fish, wildlife, and recreation conservation projects. In developing its plan and adopting specific projects, the Commission will give significant weight to the Service's recommendations. Should the Commission choose to not follow Service recommendations, it will seek resolution through active consultation with the Service. As appropriate, the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources will be asked to be involved in these consultations as that agency also has co-responsibilities under the FWCA. Should no agreement be reached, the Commission will document its decision and provide this to the Service. The Commission recognizes that the Service has a responsibility to forward its FWCA reports to the Secretary regardless of the resolution of issues contained in the reports. The Commission recognizes that several projects contained in Title II, Section 304, and Section 315 have previously been subjected to Service evaluation pursuant to FWCA. Prior to reallocating funds authorized for these projects, the Commission will formally consult with the Service regarding the relative adequacy of proposed new projects, or significant modifications to Title II, Section 304, or Section 315 projects, in mitigating for impacts to fish and wildlife resources.",
            "(iii) The Commission will comply with applicable provisions of the ESA and, accordingly, will consult with the Service regarding activities that may affect a listed or candidate species, regardless whether the effect is beneficial or adverse. In addition, the Commission will endeavor to undertake mitigation and conservation projects that are consistent with an adopted recovery plan for a listed species and that aid in the protection of candidate species.",
            "(iv) The Commission will, in accordance with the Act, formally seek the Service's approval prior to reallocating funds from a project whose primary objectives are the protection and/or restoration of fish and wildlife resources to a project whose objectives are primarily related to recreation. No such funds will be reallocated unless this meets with the approval of the Service.",
            "(v) The Commission anticipates that the Service will be an active participant in the planning for, and implementation, of mitigation and conservation projects undertaken pursuant to the Commission's plan.",
            "(vi) The Commission will invite the Service to participate in NEPA activities undertaken or funded by the Commission that bear on fish and/or wildlife resources. The form that this participation will take will be determined on a case-by-case basis and will require agreement on the part of both agencies.",
            "(5) Utah Division of Wildlife Resources. As is the case with other states, the State of Utah has the exclusive jurisdiction over non-migratory fish and wildlife and shared jurisdiction (with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service) over all migratory birds and Federally listed threatened and endangered fish and wildlife within the state. The applicable state law is Utah Code, Section 23-15-2, which states that \u201cAll wildlife within the state, including but not limited to wildlife on public or private lands or in public or private waters within the state, shall fall within the jurisdiction of the Division of Wildlife Resources.\u201d The Utah Division of Wildlife Resources (UDWR) has authorities and responsibilities at the state level similar to those of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service at the Federal level, and, like the Service, has mandated authorities under the Federal Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act that relate directly to Federal Reclamation project mitigation. These authorities are described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. In addition, the Act provides for the UDWR to assume primary responsibility for implementing measures associated with the Act after the Commission expires. In addition to the UDWR's responsibilities and authorities discussed above, the State of Utah also has jurisdiction over other activities that are relevant to the Commission's plan, including the granting of water rights and, except on Federal and tribal lands, management of land use. For purposes of plan development and implementation, the following will guide the Commission's relationship to the UDWR:",
            "(i) The Commission acknowledges the biological expertise of the UDWR with regard to Federal reclamation projects and other Commission activities relating to the protection and restoration of fish and wildlife resources and will seek to utilize this expertise to the fullest extent practicable. The Commission further recognizes the similarity in agency missions with regard to fish and wildlife mitigation and conservation and is committed to a strong and productive partnership with the UDWR in this regard.",
            "(ii) The Commission acknowledges the UDWR's authority over the management of fish and wildlife within the State and will take no action that is inconsistent with this authority.",
            "(iii) The Commission acknowledges that the UDWR has a mandated authority regarding the planning and monitoring of Federal reclamation mitigation. As is the case with the Service, the Commission will formally consult with the UDWR regarding projects that are subject to the FWCA. These include both projects directly related to mitigation for Federal reclamation projects and applicable fish and wildlife conservation projects not directly related to any Federal reclamation project. Consultation will be in accordance with procedures defined in the FWCA. It is anticipated that this consultation will be conducted in conjunction with the Service. However, the Commission recognizes that the UDWR has the right to prepare recommendations independent of the Service should it so desire. The Commission will, in making its decisions, give significant weight to recommendations made by the UDWR. Should the Commission choose to not follow the UDWR's recommendations, it will seek to resolve outstanding issues through active consultation with the UDWR. As appropriate, the Service will be asked to be involved in these consultations. Should no agreement be reached, the Commission will document its decision and provide this to the UDWR. The Commission recognizes that several mitigation projects contained in Title II, Section 304, and Section 315 have previously been subjected to the UDWR evaluation pursuant to FWCA. As is the case with the Service, the Commission will specifically consult with the UDWR prior to significantly modifying or reallocating funds away from these projects.",
            "(iv) The Commission will specifically consult with the UDWR regarding any project that might have an affect on species identified by the UDWR as wildlife species of special concern and species listed by the UDWR Natural Heritage Program as G1 and G2 plant and animal species.",
            "(v) The Commission anticipates that the UDWR will be an active participant in the planning for, and implementation, of mitigation and conservation projects undertaken pursuant to the Commission's plan.",
            "(vi) The Commission will invite the UDWR to participate in NEPA activities undertaken or funded by the Commission that bear on fish and/or wildlife resources. The form that this participation will take will be determined on a case-by-case basis and will require agreement on the part of both agencies."

The Commission is committed to full and active compliance with these laws as well as applicable State environmental law.",
            "(b) The Commission's NEPA procedures are addressed in a different chapter of the agency's administrative rules. Because the plan is subject to alteration or amendment under a number of circumstances, the plan does not constitute an irretrievable commitment of resources and thus is not subject to NEPA. Projects preliminarily selected for funding by the Commission will, however, be subject to formal NEPA review. The Commission recognizes that these procedures may affect both project budgets and scheduling and will therefore give specific consideration to this when preparing the plan. As described in \u00a7 10005.16 the plan will identify, at a reconnaissance level, the need for individual projects to comply with NEPA and other Federal and State environmental laws and the opportunities available for consolidating NEPA review into programmatic or watershed-wide analysis as appropriate."

            "The terms \u201cmitigation\u201d and \u201cconservation\u201d are used repeatedly throughout the Act and committee reports accompanying the Act. The importance of these terms is exemplified by the fact that Congress saw fit to include them in the official name of the Commission. The Commission interprets the term \u201cmitigation\u201d to mean activities undertaken to avoid or lessen environmental impacts associated with a Federal reclamation project or, should impact occur, to protect, restore, or enhance fish, wildlife, and recreation resources adversely affected by the project. Mitigation at the site of the impact typically involves restoration or replacement. Off-site mitigation might involve protection, restoration, or enhancement of a similar resource value at a different location. Mitigation may also involve substituting one resource feature for another. In meeting its mitigation responsibilities, the Commission sees an obligation to give priority to protection and restoration activities that are within the same watershed as the original impact and that address the same fish, wildlife, or recreation resource that was originally affected. The Commission's \u201cconservation\u201d authority allows it to invest in the conservation of fish, wildlife, and recreation resources generally, and not directly associated with any Federal reclamation project. Conservation projects may, therefore, be considered for any area of the state, regardless of the presence of a reclamation project. Nothing in this section is meant to restrict consideration of conservation projects directly associated with a Federal reclamation project. The Commission recognizes that, with limited resources, it is not possible to address the entire range of fish, wildlife, and recreation needs throughout the State. Indeed, addressing only the most critical issues will require prudent and judicious planning and use of resources. This section defines the areas where the Commission intends to focus its attention over the long-term and, in so doing, provides guidance for the development of the Commission's mitigation and conservation plan. By defining priorities, the Commission narrows the options of applicants in making recommendations for potential projects, and of the Commission itself in selecting measures to be incorporated into the plan.",
            "(a) Priority resources. The Commission's intent is to focus expenditures and activities on those areas and resources where the Commission believes that it can, consistent with its mandate, have the greatest positive impact. Accordingly, it is the policy of the Commission that projects selected for the plan must accomplish one or more of the following:",
            "(1) Protect and/or restore aquatic systems that provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife,",
            "(2) Protect and/or restore wetland and riparian systems that provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife,",

            "(4) Provide outdoor recreation opportunities that are dependent on the natural environment and that support the conservation of aquatic systems, and/or",
            "(5) Address fish, wildlife, or recreation resources from a statewide context in order to provide essential information on aquatic systems or to assist in the establishment of statewide programs for fish, wildlife, or recreation conservation.",
            "(b) Priority projects. In recognition of its responsibility to mitigate for Federal reclamation projects, the Commission will give special consideration to projects that:",
            "(1) Address fish, wildlife, and recreation resources affected by the development of the Central Utah Project, including projects authorized in Title II, section 304, or section 315 of the Act, as described in \u00a7 10005.8,",
            "(2) Address fish, wildlife, and recreation resources affected by the development of other features of the Colorado River Storage Project in Utah, or",
            "(3) Address fish, wildlife, and recreation resources affected by the development of other Federal reclamation projects in Utah.",
            "(c) Specific objectives for five-year plans. Each five-year plan will contain a set of specific objectives derived from the above elements. Objectives will be based on the Commission's determinations of the issues and resources that are in most need of attention, and the potential for making a substantial contribution to fish, wildlife, and recreation resources. Objectives may include the targeting of certain watersheds and/or basins for priority attention based on these same two factors."

The Commission believes that, to be effective, the plan must be prepared, and evaluated, from a state-wide perspective and that, within the state, an ecosystem-based approach is appropriate. There is no one correct way to define an ecosystem or to approach ecosystem planning. The Commission concludes that, for its planning purposes, the watershed provides the appropriate geographic and ecological reference within which to evaluate proposed projects and otherwise plan its activities. In delineating watersheds, the Commission will be consistent with the best ecological and hydrological science and, to the extent possible, with the ecological and hydrological units currently used by the State of Utah, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and other applicable Federal agencies. The Commission recognizes that mitigation and conservation projects may vary in scale and that, therefore, one standard set of watersheds is not necessarily appropriate for all projects. For example, a more localized project may best be analyzed from a \u201cwatershed within a watershed\u201d perspective. Alternatively, a large-scaled project may need to be visualized from the perspective of a major river basin consisting of several watersheds. The Commission will prepare, and have available for public use, a list or map that identifies major basins, watersheds, and, where appropriate, hydrologic units within watersheds, that the Commission will use to organize its mitigation and conservation activities. This list or map may be revised from time to time as circumstances change."

            "(ii) Where alternatives exist, utilize the least cost alternative that fully meets objectives,",
            "(iii) Continue to provide value over the long term, and/or",
            "(iv) Encourage and facilitate economic efficiency among agencies.",
            "(2) Shared funding. While not an absolute requirement, projects should, when practical, be funded through cost sharing with project participants or involve other contributions. To meet the Shared Funding standard, projects should accomplish one or more of the following:",
            "(i) Have guaranteed partial funding from other sources,",
            "(ii) Have a high potential for leveraging additional funding by others in the future,",
            "(iii) Be coupled with other ongoing or proposed projects that have compatible objectives and secured non-Commission funding, and/or",
            "(iv) Involve significant in-kind contributions by the applicant and participating agencies or organizations.",
            "(3) Protection of investment. Successful implementation of projects over time will be ensured. To meet the Protection of Investment standard, projects should accomplish one or more of the following:",
            "(i) Result in permanent, as opposed to temporary, protection to fish and/or wildlife habitats,",
            "(ii) Have low maintenance cost and/or be self sustaining over the long term,",
            "(iii) Have clearly assigned operations and management responsibilities and assurances of long term support on the part of implementors,",
            "(iv) For those projects likely to require substantial operations and management expenditures, have in place a realistic strategy for obtaining the necessary funds, including, where applicable, a commitment by the applicable agency(ies) to seek necessary appropriations,",
            "(v) Contain guarantees on the part of the applicable landowner(s) or manager(s) that incompatible land uses will not be allowed, and/or",
            "(vi) Have a high probability that action will not be negated by other activities outside of the control of the land owner/manager.",
            "(c) Decision Factor 3: Agency and public involvement and commitment. The following three standards apply:",
            "(1) Partnerships. Projects should, when practical, involve a partnership among Federal and State agencies, local governments, private organizations, and/or landowners or other citizens. To meet the Partnerships standard, projects should accomplish one or more of the following:",
            "(i) Span multiple jurisdictions or otherwise require, or benefit from, inter-organizational cooperation and involvement,",
            "(ii) Have been proposed through a cooperative effort among two or more agencies, governments, and/or private entities, each having a stake in the outcome and/or possessing complementary expertise, and/or",
            "(iii) Encourage, or facilitate, the establishment of complementary management plans and programs among land and resource managers.",
            "(2) Authority and capability. The entities charged with undertaking and, after completion, managing each project must have the authority to be involved in the proposed activity and possess the administrative, financial, technical, and logistical capability necessary for successful implementation. To meet the Authority and Capability standard, projects should:",
            "(i) Be supported by documented evidence that the entities involved have previously undertaken similar work successfully, and/or",
            "(ii) Be supported by fully developed implementation plans.",
            "(3) Public support. Projects should, wherever possible, enjoy broad support within the natural resource community, and/or with the public at-large. To meet the Public Support standard, projects should:",
            "(i) Build upon previous compatible efforts that have undergone public involvement and are widely supported,",
            "(ii) Be supported by implementation plans that have previously been subjected to peer and/or public review,",
            "(iii) Have documented support from affected interests, and/or",
            "(iv) Have a high probability that agency and public support will be sustained into the future. This is especially important for multi-year projects and projects that are part of a larger, long-term initiative.",
            "(d) Decision factor 4: Consistency with laws and programs. The following two standards apply:",
            "(1) Laws and tribal rights. Projects will be consistent with the legal rights of Indian tribes and with applicable State and Federal laws.",
            "(2) Complementary activities. Projects will complement the policies, plans, and management activities of Federal and State resource management agencies and appropriate Indian tribes. To meet the Complementary Activities standard, projects should:",
            "(i) Complement, or contribute to, established, documented fish and wildlife protection and/or restoration programs,",
            "(ii) Be a component of, or support, a recognized ecosystem or watershed planning initiative where protection or restoration of fish, wildlife, or recreation is a primary goal, and/or",
            "(iii) For projects involving Federal or state lands, be consistent with, and supported by, an adopted management plan.",
            "(e) Decision Factor 5: Other contributions. The following two standards apply:",
            "(1) Public benefits. Projects will, wherever practicable, provide benefits in addition to those provided to fish, wildlife, and recreation. To meet the Public Benefits standard, projects should:",
            "(i) To the extent that this is compatible with the primary objective of protecting or restoring fish, wildlife, or outdoor recreation, provide opportunities for multiple use of resources,",
            "(ii) Provide benefits to aspects of the environment beyond fish, wildlife, and recreation,",
            "(iii) Not result in unacceptable impacts to other aspects of the environment, and/or",
            "(iv) Contribute to the social and/or economic well-being of the community, the region, and/or the State.",
            "(2) Unmet needs. Projects will satisfy significant needs that would not otherwise be met. To meet the Unmet Needs standard, projects should:",
            "(i) Address significant fish, wildlife, or recreation needs that are unable to secure adequate funding from other sources,",
            "(ii) Not duplicate actions already taken or underway, and/or",
            "(iii) Not substitute for actions that are the responsibility of another agency and that must be implemented regardless of Commission involvement. This is not meant to restrict the Commission's ability to be involved in projects advanced by land management or other agencies that, while within the general responsibility of the agency, cannot be implemented because of internal funding limitations.",
            "(f) Decision Factor 6: Compatibility with the Commission's overall program. This decision factor is relevant to the overall project portfolio rather than to individual projects. The following five standards apply:",
            "(1) Commission obligations. Taken as a whole, the project portfolio must help fulfill the Commission's obligations for mitigation of Federal reclamation projects as described in \u00a7 10005.8.",
            "(2) Project mix. The Commission's portfolio should provide an appropriate mix of projects in terms of project type, geographical distribution, and other appropriate factors. While the Commission desires to implement a broad range of projects, and to have an effect throughout the State, this alone will not determine the Commission's mix of projects. Among the factors that the Commission will consider when selecting projects are the following:",
            "(i) The Commission will consider concentrating projects in one watershed or basin if these projects are ecologically connected and are likely to result in a significant cumulative effect on fish, wildlife, and/or recreation that could not otherwise be realized.",
            "(ii) The Commission will consider implementing a major, high cost project\u2014as opposed to several smaller projects with the same total cost\u2014if that project is likely to produce net cumulative benefits to fish, wildlife, and/or recreation that exceed those of the smaller projects.",
            "(iii) The Commission will consider small projects that appear unconnected to other Commission activities if these can serve to demonstrate the viability of a certain type of protection and restoration project, or to establish the groundwork for additional fish, wildlife, and recreation initiatives.",
            "(3) Timing. Projects should address needs that are time sensitive. To meet the Timing standard, projects should:",
            "(i) Target immediate, high priority needs,",
            "(ii) Target opportunities that are of limited duration,",
            "(iii) Preempt future crises, and/or",
            "(iv) Be consistent with identified \u201ccritical paths\u201d or other logical, multiple-year project phasing plans.",
            "(4) Project completion. Ongoing projects that are making satisfactory progress will generally be approved for continued funding prior to allocating funds for new projects.",
            "(5) Budget. The total cost of proposed projects for any given fiscal year must not exceed the Commission's anticipated budget allocation for that year. When the total cost of qualified projects exceeds funding capability, the Commission will re-evaluate all qualified projects and identify those that, in combination, produce the most meaningful results. High cost projects will be subjected to particular scrutiny and may be scaled back, phased over multiple years, or deferred if doing otherwise would preclude other worthwhile but lower cost projects."

            "Projects proposed for inclusion in the plan will be subjected to a systematic evaluation using the decision factors delineated in \u00a7 10005.19. The Commission may, at any time in the project evaluation process, contact applicants to ask for clarification, to propose modifications, or to otherwise cause the formulation of project proposals that are in keeping with the Commission's authority and mission. The result of the evaluation will be a preliminary list of eligible projects, arrayed by year over the term of the plan. The evaluation will adhere to the following process:",
            "(a) Each project will be arrayed according to location (by watershed), project type, and the resource that the project seeks to address.",
            "(b) Each project's consistency with Commission policy delineated in \u00a7 10005.12 will be determined.",
            "(c) Complementary, competing, and duplicative projects will be identified. (If warranted, applicants may be asked to combine efforts or otherwise modify projects.)",
            "(d) Projects that satisfy obligations described in \u00a7 10005.8 will be identified.",
            "(e) Using best professional judgement, Commission staff will evaluate each project according to the standards delineated in \u00a7 10005.19 with the exception of Decision Factor 6, which relates to the Commission's overall portfolio and is, therefore, not applicable to the evaluation of a specific project.",
            "(1) For each standard, a preliminary rating will be made, with the project rated as:",
            "(i) Exceeding minimum standard,",
            "(ii) Meeting minimum standard,",
            "(iii) Minor deficiency in meeting standard,",
            "(iv) Deficient, or",
            "(v) Not applicable.",
            "(2) Commission ratings will be contrasted to those of applicants and major discrepancies re-evaluated. Commission findings will be recorded and will be available for review.",
            "(f) Each project will be given an overall rating based on the extent to which it meets Commission criteria as defined in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section. The rating will be made on the basis of best professional judgement using quantitative and/or qualitative rating techniques as appropriate. A given project need not meet all standards to be selected for inclusion in the Commission's plan. A project may, for example, be deficient in an area that the Commission determines is not important for that type of project or, alternatively, deficiencies in some areas may be off-set by major assets in others. A tiered rating scale will be used, with projects grouped into two or more categories according to how well they meet Commission criteria.",
            "(g) Projects with moderate to high ratings will then be re-evaluated from a multiple project perspective. Decision Factor 6, Compatibility with the Commission's Overall Program, will be the focus of this evaluation. For those areas with a concentration of projects this might involve a watershed-wide analysis. It will also involve a state-wide analysis. As with the previous step, the evaluation will be conducted using best professional judgement and may involve a variety of applicable techniques."

          "heading": "\u00a7 10005.21   Amending the plan.",
          "paragraphs": [
            "The Commission considers the plan to be a dynamic instrument that guides decisions over time and is capable of responding to changing circumstances. Amendments to the plan provide the vehicle for maintaining this dynamic quality.",
            "(a) Types of plan amendment. The Commission recognizes three distinct types of plan amendment: comprehensive revisions, substantive revisions, and technical revisions. The particulars regarding each is as follows:",
            "(1) Comprehensive revision. The Act requires that the Commission \u201cdevelop and adopt\u201d a plan every five years. At the end of each five year period the Commission will undertake a comprehensive review of the plan to determine its adequacy and the need for revision. The need to revise, and add to, the Commission's portfolio of proposed projects will be central to this review. Other elements, for example, reconsideration of the Commission's objectives for the preceding five-year period and the Commission's standards for selecting projects, may also be reconsidered. Based on this review the Commission may call for the preparation of a new plan. The consultation procedures described in \u00a7 10005.7 will apply, as will the procedures described in \u00a7 10005.17, and the procedures described in \u00a7 10005.18. The Commission is not obligated to wait five years to undertake such revision to the plan. This may be undertaken at any time that the Commission deems appropriate.",
            "(2) Substantive revision. The Commission may, from time to time, determine that changes to the plan's list of projects are in order. Typically this will take the form of substituting a project in the plan with a new project, changing the order for implementation, or making significant modifications to previously selected projects. When the Commission determines that there is a need for such substantive changes, a formal announcement will be made and interested parties will be given the opportunity to provide recommendations following the procedures described in \u00a7 10005.18. Changes of this nature will not necessitate a total revision to the plan but rather involve select modifications to specific portions of the plan. Changes to other specific elements of the plan may also be amended in this way. Portions of the plan that are proposed for modification will be released in draft form, with the public given thirty days to provide comments prior to formal adoption by the Commission. Substantive amendments provide a way to incrementally amend the plan over time without the necessity of a major rewrite and will be central to the Commission's planning process. The Commission will specifically consider the need for substantive amendments on at least an annual basis. Consideration of substantive amendments will typically be made in concert with preparation of the annual budget request.",
            "(3) Technical revision. Technical revisions include changes that correct inadvertent errors or provide current information, other minor revisions that do not substantively modify the plan, or, changes in the particulars of one or more projects that do not change basic project goals and objectives nor substantively modify expected environmental effects. Technical revisions to projects might include, but are not limited to, changes in the list of participating organizations, changes in the exact location of certain project activities, and changes to specific tasks. Substitution of one project for another, or aggregation of projects, may also be considered a technical revision if the projects possess similar qualities and the action is supported by affected parties and the general public. Technical revisions do not constitute a formal amendment to the plan and do not require the notification and reporting procedures of a formal amendment. Affected agencies and interests must, however, be consulted, and the rationale for making the technical revision documented. The plan document will be corrected to reflect technical revisions, and a historical record kept in order to track the plan's evolution.",
            "(b) Public petitions. Agencies and members of the public have the right to, at any time, petition the Commission to open the plan to comprehensive or substantive amendments. Petitions must be made in writing and should state the specific reason why the action is requested. The petition may be accompanied by a specific project recommendation. The Commission will, during the public session of the next official Commission meeting, announce that such a petition has been received. The Commission may choose to vote on the petition at that time or to take the matter under advisement until the following Commission meeting at which time the Commission must vote to determine if the petition has merit. Following acceptance of a petition the Commission will promptly establish the procedures and schedule that will be followed in considering amendments. Project recommendations made pursuant to a petition must be presented using the format described in \u00a7 10005.18 and will be evaluated in the manner described in \u00a7 10005.20. Proposals for technical amendments do not require a formal petition. Written requests for technical amendment will be acted upon by the Commission in a timely manner."
