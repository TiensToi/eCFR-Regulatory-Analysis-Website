            "(a) Determining the length of delay for the bag. For the purpose of determining whether a checked bag is significantly delayed as defined in \u00a7 260.2, the length of delay is calculated from the time the passenger is given the opportunity to deplane from a flight at the passenger's final destination airport (the beginning of the delay) to the time that the carrier has delivered the bag to a location agreed upon by the passenger and carrier (e.g., passenger's home or hotel) or the time that the bag has been picked up by the passenger or another person acting on behalf of the passenger at the passenger's final destination airport (the end of the delay).",

If there is no such unique identifier assigned, carriers must refund the highest per bag fee or fees charged for the multiple bags.",

A carrier may require a passenger who fails to meet the minimum check-in time requirement for a flight or is a standby passenger for a flight (i.e., a passenger who lacks a reservation on that flight and is waiting at the gate for a seat to be available on the flight) to agree to a new baggage delivery date and location in situations where the carrier is unable to place the passenger's checked bag on that flight because of the limited time available. The carrier must not require the passenger to waive the right to a refund of bag fees if the bag is lost, the right to compensation for damaged, lost, or pilfered bags, or the right to incidental expenses reimbursement arising from delayed bags beyond the agreed upon delivery date, consistent with the Department's regulation in 14 CFR part 254 and applicable international treaties."

Such articles were certified by NASA to the Commissioner of Customs for duty-free entry to be launched into space or space parts or necessary and uniquely associated support equipment for use in connection with a launch into space. This exemption from duty was provided for in Subheading 9808.00.80, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) (19 U.S.C. 1202). Also, HTSUS, Chapter VIII, U.S. note 1, pursuant to the same law, provided that return of articles by NASA from space to the United States would not be considered an importation, and similarly not be subject to a duty.",
            "As a result of the Uruguay Round agreements of the 1994 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, this authority was revised and expanded in scope. It now provides that imports of articles for NASA's use and articles imported to implement NASA's international programs, including articles to be launched into space, parts thereof, ground support equipment, and uniquely associated equipment for use in connection with NASA's international programs and launch service agreements would be eligible for duty-free customs entry upon certification by NASA to the Commissioner of Customs. The revised authorities also provided, in U.S. note 1 to subchapter VIII of chapter 98 of the HTSUS, that articles brought into the customs territory of the United States by NASA from space or from a foreign country as part of a NASA's international programs would not be considered imports or subject to customs entry requirements."

If the efforts required of the applicant or recipient under \u00a7 1250.105 to provide information as to the availability of the program or activity, and the rights of beneficiaries under this regulation, have failed to overcome these consequences, it will become necessary for such applicant or recipient to take additional steps to make the benefits fully available to racial and nationality groups previously subjected to discrimination. This action might take the form, for example, of special arrangements for obtaining referrals or making selections which will insure that groups previously subjected to discrimination are adequately served.",

In such circumstances an applicant or recipient may properly give special consideration to race, color, or national origin to make the benefits of its program more widely available to such groups, not then being adequately served. For example, where a university is not adequately serving members of a particular racial or nationality group, it may establish special recruitment policies to make its program better known and more readily available to such group, and take other steps to provide that group with more adequate service."

If the assurance is not made a part of the application, the application shall identify the assurance which is applicable to the application. One assurance shall suffice for all applications of an applicant if the assurance complies with the conditions made applicable by this part to each such application for Federal financial assistance. Every assurance shall include provisions which give the United States a right to seek its judicial enforcement.",

In the case of an application for Federal financial assistance for providing real property or structures thereon, the assurance shall obligate the recipient, or in the case of a subsequent transfer, the transferee, for the period during which the real property or structures are used for a purpose for which the Federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits.",

(1) In the case of application by an institution of higher education or any other organization for Federal financial assistance for a program or activity which involves participation by students, fellows or trainees, including but not limited to assistance for research, training, or the provision of facilities, the assurance required by this \u00a7 1250.104 shall extend to admission practices and to all other practices relating to the treatment of students or other participants.",

            "(d) Assurances for construction of facilities. In the case of assistance for the construction of a facility, or part thereof, the assurance shall extend to the entire facility and to facilities operated in connection therewith. In grants to assist in the construction of facilities for the provision of research, training, or educational services, assurances will be required that services will be provided without discrimination, to the same extent that discrimination would be forbidden as a condition of grants for the support of such services. Thus, as a condition of grants for the construction of academic, research or other facilities at institutions of higher education, assurances will be required that there will be no discrimination in the admission or treatment of students. Also, see paragraph (c) of this section for the requirement as to the applicability of the assurance to the applicant's organization.",

The instrument effecting or recording the transfer, shall contain a covenant running with the land assuring nondiscrimination for the period during which the real property is used for a purpose for which the Federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits. Where no transfer of property is involved, but property is improved with Federal financial assistance, the recipient shall agree to include such a covenant in any subsequent transfer of such property. Where the property is obtained from the Federal Government, such covenant may also include a condition coupled with a right to be reserved by NASA to revert title to the property in the event of a breach of the covenant where, in the discretion of the responsible NASA official, such a condition and right of reverter is appropriate to the statute under which the real property is obtained and to the nature of the grant and the grantee.",

Thus, NASA is required to include IGA-based cross-waivers in agreements for ISS activities that fall within the scope of \u201cProtected Space Operations,\u201d as defined in \u00a7 1266.102. The provisions of \u00a7 1266.102 provide the regulatory basis for cross-waiver clauses to be incorporated into NASA agreements for activities that implement the IGA and the memoranda of understanding between the United States and its respective international partners.
