            "(b) An application requesting that a waiver be made effective, with respect to a particular vessel, may be made by any authorized representative of an agency of the United States Government or any other interested person (including the master, agent, or owner of the vessel involved). Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the application shall be in writing. The application shall be delivered to the Coast Guard District Commander or to his designated representative at the port or place where the vessel is located. In the case of a vessel in any foreign port or place, the application shall be made to the designated representative of the Commandant at such port or place, or if the Coast Guard has not established facilities in such port or place, to the nearest designated representative of the Commandant at a port or place where such facilities have been established. Every application shall contain a statement of the particular provisions of law with respect to which waiver of compliance is requested, a certification that the waiver of compliance with such laws with respect to the vessel involved is necessary in the interest of national defense and, an outline of the facts upon which such certification is based. The Coast Guard District Commander (or his designated representative or the designated representative of the Commandant, as the case may be) shall promptly examine every application for the purpose of determining whether the necessity for prompt action is such as to require that the waiver be made effective by him without reference to the Commandant. In any case in which it appears to the Coast Guard officer concerned that reference of the application to the Commandant for action would not delay the sailing of the vessel or otherwise be contrary to the interest of national defense, the application shall be so referred. In all other cases, such Coast Guard officer shall give immediate consideration to the application and if he reaches the conclusion that the urgency of the situation outweighs the marine hazard involved, then such waiver shall be made effective in regard to such vessel to the extent and under the circumstances specified by him.",
            "(c) The Coast Guard officer making such a waiver effective pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section shall immediately prepare, in triplicate, an order setting forth the name of the vessel involved, the laws (also regulations, if any) with respect to which the waiver is effective, the extent to which compliance with such laws (also regulations, if any) is waived, and the period for which the waiver shall be effective. If practicable, one copy of this order shall be delivered to the master of the vessel involved before such vessel sails. In any case where the order is not delivered to the master, it shall be delivered to the owner, operator, or agent of the vessel without delay. One copy of the order shall be transmitted to the Commandant and the remaining copy kept on file.",
            "(d) In any case of extreme urgency the application for a waiver may be made orally, and if the Coast Guard District Commander (or his designated representative or the designated representative of the Commandant, as the case may be) reaches the conclusion referred to in paragraph (b) of this section, the waiver shall be made effective without further delay, subject to the condition that the application be reduced to writing and delivered within such period after the date of the oral request as the Coast Guard officer making the waiver effective shall specify in the order.",

            "(a) Manner of deposit. The deposit required by section 511 of the Act must be made in a construction reserve fund established with a depository or depositories approved by the Administration and subject to the joint control of the Administration and the taxpayer. It is not necessary to establish a separate fund with respect to each vessel or share in a vessel sold or lost.",
            "(b) Amount of deposit. With respect to any vessel sold or lost, or a share therein, the deposit must be in an amount equal to the \u201cnet proceeds\u201d of the sale, or the \u201cnet indemnity\u201d for the loss. By \u201cnet proceeds\u201d and \u201cnet indemnity\u201d is meant (1) the depositor's interest in the adjusted basis of the vessel plus (2) the amount of gain which would be recognized for tax purposes in the absence of section 511 of the Act. In determining \u201cnet proceeds\u201d, the amount necessarily paid or incurred for brokers' commissions is to be deducted from the gross amount of the sales price. In the event the taxpayer is an affiliate or associate of the buyer, the amount of the sales price shall not exceed the fair market value of the vessel or vessels sold as determined by the Administration. In such case the taxpayer shall furnish evidence sufficient, in the opinion of the Administration, to establish that the sales price is not in excess of the fair market value. In determining \u201cnet indemnity\u201d, the amount necessarily paid or incurred purely for collection, or rate of exchange discounts on the payment, of the indemnity is to be deducted from the gross amount of collectible indemnity. In case of the sale or loss of several vessels or share therein, a deposit of the \u201cnet proceeds\u201d or \u201cnet indemnity\u201d with respect to one or more of the vessels or shares is permissible. Where several vessels or shares are sold for a lump sum, the \u201cnet proceeds\u201d allocated to each vessel or share shall be determined in accordance with any reasonable rule satisfactory to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. The taxpayer must deposit the full amount of each payment (including cash, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness) as a single deposit in the construction reserve fund. A payment divided between two or more depositories will be regarded as a single deposit. Amounts received by the taxpayer prior to the date of consummation of the sale of the vessel shall be considered as having been received by the taxpayer at the time the sale is consummated.",
            "(c) Purchase-money obligations. Where the proceeds from the sale of a vessel include purchase-money obligations, such obligations together with the entire collateral therefor, or, in the case of deposit of the proceeds of a share in the vessel, a proportionate part of the obligations and collateral as determined by the Administration, shall be deposited, with the remainder of the proceeds, in the construction reserve fund as a part of the \u201cnet proceeds\u201d. The depository shall receive payment of all amounts due on such purchase-money obligations and such amounts shall be placed in the fund in substitution for the portion of the obligations paid. All installments of purchase-money obligations shall be paid directly into the fund by the obligor. In the event any such installment is not so deposited, the Administration, at any time after the due date, may require the taxpayer to deposit an amount equal to such installment. If the taxpayer so desires, he may deposit in the construction reserve fund cash or approved securities in an amount equal to the face value of any purchase-money obligations in lieu of depositing such obligations.",

Where a vessel is subject to a mortgage or other encumbrance at the time of its sale or loss and the taxpayer actually receives only an amount representing the equity therein or a share in such equity corresponding to his share in the vessel, he shall deposit in the construction reserve fund such amount and concurrently therewith other funds in an amount equal to the difference between the amount received and the \u201cnet proceeds\u201d or \u201cnet indemnity\u201d. Such other funds may be in the form of cash, or, subject to the approval of the Administration, (1) interest-bearing securities, or (2) an irrevocable and unconditional commitment to finance the construction or acquisition of a new vessel in whole or in part by an obligor approved by the Administration in an amount equal to the amount by which the \u201cnet proceeds\u201d exceed the cash or securities deposited in the fund.",

The date funds are obligated under a contract for the construction, reconstruction, reconditioning, or acquisition of new vessels, or for the liquidation of purchase-money indebtedness on such vessels, rather than the date of payment from the fund, will determine the order of application against the deposits in the fund. When a contract for the construction, reconstruction, reconditioning, or acquisition of new vessels, or for the liquidation of purchase-money indebtedness on such vessels is entered into, amounts on deposit in the construction reserve fund will be deemed to be obligated to the extent of the amount of the taxpayer's liability under the contract. Deposits will be deemed to be so obligated in the order of deposit, each new contract obligating the earliest deposit not previously expended, obligated, or withdrawn. If the liability under the contract exceeds the amount in the construction reserve fund, the contract will be deemed to obligate, to the extent of that part of such excess not otherwise satisfied, the earliest deposit or deposits thereafter made.",

            "(b) Time of construction. A vessel will be deemed to be constructed after December 31, 1939, only if construction was commenced after that date. Subject to the provisions of this section, a new vessel may be newly built for the taxpayer, or may be acquired after it is built.",

Within three years from the date of any deposit in a construction reserve fund, unless extension is granted as provided in \u00a7 287.22, such deposit must be obligated under a contract for the construction or acquisition of a new vessel or vessels (or in the discretion of the Administration for a share therein), with not less than 12\n1/2 percent of the construction or contract price of the entire vessel or vessels actually paid or irrevocably committed on account thereof or must be expended or obligated for the liquidation of existing or subsequently incurred purchase-money indebtedness to persons other than a parent company of, or a company affiliated or associated with, the mortgagor on a new vessel or vessels.

The fixed or base price, as the case may be, shall be fair and reasonable as determined by the Maritime Administration. Any financial or other interests between the taxpayer and the contractor shall be disclosed to the Administration by the taxpayer.

Noncompliance with the provisions of section 511 of the Act or the regulations in this part relative to the utilization of the deposited amounts may also, inasmuch as the provision of section 511(f) of the Act is then inapplicable, warrant an examination to ascertain whether such amounts constitute an unreasonable accumulation of earnings and profits within the meaning of part I (section 531 and following), subchapter G, chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, or corresponding provisions of prior law.

          "paragraphs": [
            "Fair and reasonable rates for the carriage of preference cargoes on U.S.-flag commercial vessels shall be determined as follows:",
            "(a) Operating cost component\u2014(1) General. An operating cost component for each category, based on average operating costs of participating vessels within a vessel size category, shall be determined, at least twice yearly, on the basis of operating cost data for the calendar year immediately preceding the current year that has been submitted in accordance with \u00a7 382.2. The operating cost component shall include all operating cost categories, as specified in 46 CFR 232.5, Form MA-172, Schedule 310, Operating Expenses. For purposes of these regulations, charter hire expenses are not considered operating costs. MARAD shall index such data yearly to the current period, utilizing the escalation factors for wage and non-wage costs used in escalating operating subsidy costs for the same period.",
            "(2) Fuel. Fuel costs within each category shall be determined based on the average actual fuel consumptions, at sea and in port, and current fuel prices in effect at the time of the preference cargo voyage(s).",
            "(3) Vessel categories. Vessels shall be placed in categories by deadweight capacities (DWT), as follows:",
            "(b) Capital Component\u2014(1) General. An average capital cost component for each category shall be constructed, at least twice yearly, consisting of vessel depreciation, interest, and return on equity.",
            "(2) Items included. The capital cost component shall include:",
            "(i) Depreciation. The owners' capitalized vessel costs, including capitalized improvements, shall be depreciated on a straight-line basis over a 20-year economic life, except vessels purchased or reconstructed when their age was greater than 10 years old. To the extent vessels are chartered or leased, the operator shall submit the capitalized cost of the vessel owner and imputed interest rate. If these items are not furnished, MARAD will construct these amounts. When vessels more than 10 years old are acquired, a depreciation period of 10 years shall be used. Capitalized improvements made to vessels more than 10 years old shall be depreciated over a 10-year period. When vessels more than 10 years old are reconstructed, MARAD will determine the depreciation period.",
            "(ii) Interest. The cost of debt shall be determined by applying each vessel owner's actual interest rates to the outstanding vessel indebtedness. MARAD shall assume that original vessel indebtedness is 75 percent of the owners' capitalized vessel costs, including capitalized improvements, and that annual principal payments are made in equal installments over the economic life of the vessels as determined in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. Where an operator uses a variable interest rate, the operator's actual interest rate at the time of calculation of the average capital cost component shall be used. The ten-year Treasury bill (T-bill) rate plus one percent on the first business day of the year or the first business day on or after July 1 shall be used for operators without vessel debt and when the actual rate is unavailable.",
            "(iii) Return on equity. The rate of return on equity shall be computed in the same manner as described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. For the purpose of determining equity, it shall be assumed that the vessel's constructed net book value, less outstanding constructed principal, is equity. The constructed net book values shall equal the owners' capitalized cost minus accumulated straight-line depreciation.",
            "(3) Return on working capital. For each voyage a return on working capital shall be included as a voyage related capital cost element, and thus not part of the averaged costs. Working capital shall equal the dollar amount necessary to cover 100 percent of the averaged operating costs and estimated voyage costs for the voyage. The rate of return shall be based on an average of the most recent return of stockholders' equity for a cross section of transportation companies, including maritime companies.",
            "(4) New vessel allowance. Newly constructed vessels and vessels acquired during or before their fifth year of age will receive an additional allowance for acquisition capital as part of the capital cost element. For the first year following construction or acquisition by the operator, a daily amount equal to ten percent of capitalized acquisition costs, divided by 300 operating days, shall be included. This amount shall be reduced by one percent of capitalized acquisition costs each subsequent year. No allowance shall be included after the tenth year following construction.",
            "(5) Voyage component. The annual average depreciation, interest, and return on equity for vessels in each category shall be divided by 300 vessel operating days to yield the daily cost factors. Total voyage days shall be applied to the daily cost factors and totaled with the return on working capital and new vessel allowance for the voyage to determine the daily capital cost component.",
            "(c) Port and cargo handling cost component. MARAD shall calculate an estimate of all port and cargo handling costs on the basis of the reported cargo tender terms. The port and cargo handling cost component shall be based on vessels in the category and the most current information available verified by information submitted in accordance with \u00a7 382.2(c), or as otherwise determined by MARAD, such as by analysis of independent data obtained from chartering agencies.",
            "(d) Brokerage and overhead component. An allowance for broker's commission and overhead expenses of 8.5 percent shall be added to the sum of the operating cost component, the capital cost component, and the port and cargo handling cost component.",
            "(e) Determination of voyage days. The following assumptions shall be made in determining the number of preference cargo voyage days:",
            "(1) The voyage shall be round-trip with the return in ballast to a port or port range selected by MARAD as the most appropriate, unless the vessel is scrapped or sold after discharge of the preference cargo and does not return to the United States as a U.S.-flag vessel. In this event, only voyage days from the load port to the discharge port, including time allowed to discharge, shall be included.",
            "(2) Cargo is loaded and discharged as per cargo tender terms interpreted in accordance with the \u201cInternational Rules For the Interpretation of Trade Terms\u201d (INCOTERMS) published by the International Chamber of Commerce.",
            "(3) Total loading and discharge time includes the addition of a factor to account for delays and days not worked.",
            "(4) One extra port day is included at each anticipated bunkering port.",
            "(5) An allowance shall be included for canal transits, when appropriate.",
            "(6) Transit time shall be based on the average speed of vessels in the category. When calculating the vessels' average speed, individual vessel speeds will be reduced by five percent for self-propelled vessels and ten percent for tugs/barges to account for weather conditions.",
            "(f) Determination of cargo carried. The amount of cargo tonnage used to calculate the rate shall be based on the tender offer or charter party terms. In instances when separate parcels of preference cargo are booked or considered for booking on the same vessel, whether under a single program or different programs, a guideline rate shall be provided based on the combined voyage.",
            "(g) Total rate. The guideline rate shall be the total of the operating cost component, the capital cost component, the port and cargo handling cost component, and the broker's commission and overhead component. The fair and reasonable rate can be expressed as total voyage revenue or be divided by the amount of cargo to be carried, as prescribed in paragraph (f) of this section, and expressed as cost per ton, whichever MARAD deems most appropriate."

If an objection to an application is received, additional information may be sought from the objector. The applicant will be given a sufficient amount of time to respond. The Director, Office of Ports and Domestic Shipping, will then either make a decision based on the written submissions and all available information or, on MARAD's motion or at the applicant's request, hold a hearing on the application and make a decision based on the hearing record. The decision will be communicated to the applicant, commenters and the United States Coast Guard in writing and placed in the docket. If MARAD grants a waiver, the applicant must thereafter contact the Coast Guard to obtain the necessary documentation for domestic operation. MARAD's waiver does not satisfy other requirements of the Coast Guard for documentation. The waiver, if approved, will be assigned to the vessel.",

We may, upon the request of a U.S. builder or a coastwise trade business of a person who employs U.S.-built vessels or upon our own initiative propose to revoke a waiver granted under this part, on the basis that the waiver was obtained through fraud. The grantee of the waiver in question will be notified directly by mail, and a notice will be published in the Federal Register. The original docket of the application will be reopened. We may request additional information from the applicant granted the waiver or from any respondent to the notice. The Director, Office of Ports and Domestic Shipping, will then either make a decision based on the written submissions and all available information or, on MARAD's motion or at the applicant's request, hold a hearing on the proposed revocation and make a decision based on the hearing record. The decision will be communicated in writing to: the applicant granted the waiver, the requestor (if any), each respondent to the proposed revocation notice, the Coast Guard; and placed in the docket. If MARAD revokes a waiver, the Coast Guard, automatically and without further proceedings, shall revoke the vessel's coastwise endorsement.",
            "(c) Review of determinations. (1) The decisions by the Director, Office of Ports and Domestic Shipping, to grant a waiver, deny a waiver, or revoke a waiver will not be final until time for discretionary review by the Administrator has expired. Each decision to grant, deny, or revoke a waiver will be made in writing and a copy of the written decision will be provided to each applicant and other parties to the decision. Applicants, persons who requested revocation of a waiver, and persons who submitted comments in response to a Federal Register notice may petition the Administrator to review a decision by the Director, Office of Ports and Domestic Shipping, to grant a waiver, deny a waiver, or revoke a waiver within five (5) business days after such decision is filed in the docket. Each petition for review should state the petitioner's standing and the reasons review is being sought, clearly pointing out alleged errors of fact or misapplied points of law. Within five (5) business days of submission of a petition for review, the applicant, and other persons with standing, may request that the Administrator not review a decision by the Director, Office of Ports and Domestic Shipping, to grant, deny, or revoke a waiver. Such petitions and responses must either be sent by facsimile to the Secretary, Maritime Administration, at (202) 366-9206 or filed electronically in the appropriate DOT docket at http://dms.dot.gov. The Administrator will decide whether to review within five (5) business days following the last day for submission of a request that the Administrator not take review. If the Administrator undertakes review, the decision by the Director, Office of Ports and Domestic Shipping, is stayed until final disposition. In the event the Administrator decides to undertake review, a decision will be made based on the written submissions and all available information. As a matter of discretion, the Administrator or designated representative may hold a hearing on the proposed action and make a decision based on the hearing record. The decision will be communicated in writing to the interested parties and the Coast Guard. In the review process, the decision of the Maritime Administrator is the final disposition. In the absence of any petition for review, the determination by the Director, Office of Ports and Domestic Shipping, becomes final on the sixth business day after the decision. The Secretary, MARAD, may extend any of the time limits, but only for good cause shown.",

See \u00a7 390.3 (relating to policy considerations).",

The fact that indebtedness is secured by an interest in a qualified agreement vessel is insufficient by itself to demonstrate the direct connection. It is not necessary that the lien or mortgage securing the indebtedness be on the vessel.

            "(ii) The party may also reimburse its general funds for expenditures which could have been paid initially by a qualified withdrawal, if such reimbursements are made within 120 days of such expenditure.",
            "(iii) The party may reimburse its general funds for expenditures made prior to the time an agreement or amendment is entered into, but after the party has made application therefor, if such expenditures would otherwise qualify for reimbursement pursuant to paragraphs (c)(3) (i) and (ii) of this section but for the fact that an agreement or amendment has not been executed, and if such reimbursement is effected within 120 days of the execution of an agreement or amendment.",
            "(3) Prepayment of indebtedness. The party shall not prepay principal on indebtedness with qualified withdrawals without the prior written consent of the Maritime Administrator.",

A withdrawal, including payments for indebtedness, paid to a related person, within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations thereunder, shall not constitute a qualified withdrawal unless the Maritime Administrator determines that no portion of such payment constitutes a dividend, a return of capital or a contribution of capital under the Internal Revenue Code. Transactions which include payments to a related person, will be approved if the cost of the item to be acquired, constructed or reconstructed through qualified withdrawals is or was at the time of the acquisition, construction or reconstruction its fair market value. The party must obtain the prior written permission of the Maritime Administrator before any qualified withdrawals may be paid to a related person.

            "(2) Transfer of qualified agreement vessel. In the event a qualified agreement vessel is sold or transferred to another person (see paragraph (b)(3) of \u00a7 390.11 requiring prior permission), the transferor shall require in the bill of sale that the transferee agree with the Maritime Administrator to comply with the geographic trading restrictions and to pay liquidated damages for any breach of such agreement that occurs after the transfer. The transferor shall remain liable for any violations that occurred prior to the approved transfer. However, in the case of a like kind exchange which is governed by section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if the vessel acquired by the party has an economic life equal to or greater than the length of the geographic trading restrictions that remain applicable to the transferred vessel, the acquired vessel shall be deemed to be a qualified agreement vessel and the geographic trading restrictions of the transferred vessel shall attach to the acquired vessel."

Thus, for example, if the party chooses to have the fund repay to him the amount of an overdeposit, amounts in each account, basis of assets, and any affected item will be determined as though no deposit and repayment had been made. Accordingly, in such a case, if there are insufficient amounts in an account to cover a repayment of an overdeposit (as determined before correcting the overdeposit), and the party had applied the proceeds of a qualified withdrawal from such account towards the purchase of a qualified vessel (within the meaning of \u00a7 391.11(a)(2)), then such account and the basis of the vessel shall be adjusted as of the time such withdrawal was made and proceeds were applied, and repayment shall be made from such account as adjusted. If a party chooses to treat the amount of an overdeposit as a deposit under a subceiling for a subsequent year, similar adjustments to affected items shall be made. If the amount of a withdrawal would have exceeded the amount in the fund (determined after adjusting all affected amounts by reason of correcting the overdeposit), the withdrawal to the extent of such excess shall be treated as a repayment made at the time the withdrawal was made.",

            "(b) Taxable income attributable to the operation of an agreement vessel\u2014(1) In general. For purposes of this section, taxable income attributable to the operation of an agreement vessel means the amount, if any, by which the gross income of a party for the taxable year from the operation of an agreement vessel (as defined in paragraph (f) of this section) exceeds the allowable deductions allocable to such operation (as determined under paragraph (b)(3) of this section). The term taxable income attributable to the operation of the agreement vessels means the sum of the amounts described in the preceding sentence separately computed with respect to each agreement vessel (or share therein) or, at the party's option, computed in the aggregate.",
            "(2) Gross income. (i) Gross income from the operation of agreement vessels means the sum of the revenues which are derived during the taxable year from the following:",
            "(a) Revenues derived from the transportation of passengers, freight, or mail in such vessels, including amounts from contracts for the charter of such vessels to others, from operating differential subsidies, from collections in accordance with pooling agreements and from insurance or indemnity net proceeds relating to the loss of income attributable to such agreement vessels.",
            "(b) Revenues derived from the operation of agreement vessels relating to commercial fishing activities, including the transportation of fish, support activities for fishing vessels, charters for commercial fishing, and insurance or indemnity net proceeds relating to the loss of income attributable to such agreement vessels.",
            "(c) Revenues from the rental lease, or use by others of terminal facilities, revenues from cargo handling operations and tug and lighter operations, and revenues from other services or operations which are incidental and directly related to the operation of an agreement vessel. Thus, for example, agency fees, commissions, and brokerage fees derived by the party at his place of business for effecting transactions for services incidental and directly related to shipping for the accounts of other persons are includible in gross income from the operation of agreement vessels where the transaction is of a kind customarily consummated by the party for his own account at such place of business.",
            "(d) Dividends, interest, and gains derived from assets set aside and reasonably retained to meet regularly occurring obligations relating to the shipping or fishing business directly connected with the agreement vessel which obligations cannot at all times be met from the current revenues of the business because of layups or repairs, special surveys, fluctuations in the business, and reasonably forseeable strikes (whether or not a strike actually occurs), and security amounts retained by reason of participation in conferences, pooling agreements, or similar agreements.",
            "(ii) The items of gross income described in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) (c) and (d) of this section shall be considered to be derived from the operations of a particular agreement vessel in the same proportion that the sum of the items of gross income described in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) (a) and (b) of this section which are derived from the operations of such agreement vessel bears to the party's total gross income for the taxable year from operations described in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) (a) and (b) of this section.",
            "(iii) In the case of a party who uses his own or leased agreement vessels to transport his own products, the gross income attributable to such vessel operations is an amount determined to be an arm's length charge for such transportation. The arm's length charge shall be determined by applying the principles of section 482 of the Code and the regulations thereunder as if the party transporting the product and the owner of the product were not the same person but were controlled taxpayers within the meaning of \u00a7 1.482-1(a)(4) of the Income Tax Regulations of this chapter. Gross income attributable to the operation of agreement vessels does not include amounts for which the party is allowed a deduction for percentage depletion under sections 611 and 613 of the Code.",
            "(3) Deductions. From the gross income attributable to the operation of an agreement vessel or vessels as determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, there shall be deducted in accordance with the principles of \u00a7 1.861-8 of the Income Tax Regulations of this chapter, the expenses, losses, and other deductions definitely related and therefore allocated and apportioned thereto and a ratable part of any expenses, losses, or other deductions which are not definitely related to any gross income of the party. Thus, for example, if a party has gross income attributable to the operation of an agreement vessel and other gross income and has a particular deduction definitely related to both types of gross income, such deductions must be apportioned between the two types of gross income on a reasonable basis in determining the taxable income attributable to the operation of the agreement vessel.",
            "(4) Net operating and capital loss deductions. The taxable income of a party attributable to the operation of agreement vessels shall be computed without regard to the carryback of any net operating loss deduction allowed by section 172 of the Code, the carryback of any net capital loss deduction allowed by section 165(f) of the Code, or any reduction in taxable income allowed by section 607 of the Act.",
            "(5) Method of accounting. Taxable income must be computed under the method of accounting which the party uses for Federal income tax purposes. Such method may include a method of reporting whereby items of revenue and expense properly allocable to voyages in progress at the end of any accounting period are eliminated from the computation of taxable income for such accounting period and taken into account in the accounting period in which the voyage is completed.",

            "(d) Earnings and gains from the investment or reinvestment of amounts held in a fund\u2014(1) In general. (i) Earnings and gains received or accrued by a party from the investment or reinvestment of assets in a fund is the total amount of any interest or dividends received or accrued, and gains realized, by the party with respect to assets deposited in, or purchased with amounts deposited in, such fund. Such earnings and gains are therefore required to be included in the gross income of the party unless such amount, or a portion thereof, is not taken into account under section 607(d)(1)(C) of the Act and \u00a7 391.3(b)(2)(ii) by reason of a deposit or deemed deposit into the fund. For rules relating to receipts from the sale or other disposition of nonmoney deposits into the fund, see paragraph (g) of this section.",
            "(ii) Earnings received or accrued by a party from investment or reinvestment of assets in a fund include the ratable monthly portion of original issue discount included in gross income pursuant to section 1232(a)(3) of the Code. Such ratable monthly portion shall be deemed to be deposited into the ordinary income account of the fund, but an actual deposit representing such ratable monthly portion shall not be made. For basis of a bond or other evidence of indebtedness issued at a discount, see \u00a7 391.3(b)(2)(ii)(b).",
            "(2) Gain realized. (i) The gain realized with respect to assets in the fund is the excess of the amount realized (as defined in section 1001(b) of the Code and the regulations thereunder) by the fund on the sale or other disposition of a fund asset over its adjusted basis (as defined in section 1011 of the Code) to the fund. For the adjusted basis of nonmoney deposits, see paragraph (g) of this section.",
            "(ii) Property purchased by the fund (including property considered under paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of this section as purchased by the fund) which is withdrawn from the fund in a qualified withdrawal (as defined in \u00a7 391.5) is treated as a disposition to which subdivision (i) of this subparagraph applies. For purposes of determining the amount by which the balance within a particular account will be reduced in the manner provided in \u00a7 391.6(b) (relating to order of application of qualified withdrawals against accounts) and for purposes of determining the reduction in basis of a vessel, barge, or container (or share therein) pursuant to \u00a7 391.6(c), the value of the property is its fair market value on the day of the qualified withdrawal.",
            "(3) Holding Period. Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, the holding period of fund assets shall be determined under section 1223 of the Code.",
            "(e) Leased vessels. In the case of a party who is a lessee of an agreement vessel, the maximum amount which such lessee may deposit with respect to any agreement vessel by reason of section 607(b)(1)(B) of the Act and paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section (relating to depreciation allowable) for any period shall be reduced by the amount (if any) which, under an agreement entered into under section 607 of the Act, the owner is required or permitted to deposit for such period with respect to such vessel by reason of section 607(b)(1)(B) of the Act and paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section. The amount of depreciation depositable by the lessee under this paragraph is the amount of depreciation deductible by the lessor on its income tax return, reduced by the amount described in the preceding sentence or the amount set forth in the agreement, whichever is lower.",
            "(f) Definition of agreement vessel. For purposes of this section, the term agreement vessel (as defined in \u00a7 391.11 (a)(3) and 46 CFR 390.6) includes barges and containers which are the complement of an agreement vessel and which are provided for in the agreements, agreement vessels which have been contracted for or are in the process of construction, and any shares in an agreement vessel. Solely for purposes of this section, a party is considered to have a \u201cshare\u201d in an agreement vessel if he has a right to use the vessel to generate income from its use whether or not the party would be considered as having a proprietary interest in the vessel for purposes of State or Federal law. Thus, a partner may enter into an agreement with respect to his share of the vessel owned by the partnership and he may make deposits of his distributive share of the sum of the four subceilings described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Notwithstanding the provisions of Subchapter K of the Code (relating to the taxation of partners and partnerships), the Internal Revenue Service will recognize, solely for the purposes of applying this part, an agreement by an owner of a share in an agreement vessel even though the \u201cshare\u201d arrangement is a partnership for purposes of the Code.",
            "(g) Special rules for nonmoney deposits and withdrawals\u2014(1) In general. (i) Deposits may be made in the form of money or property of the type permitted to be deposited under the agreement. (For rules relating to the types of property which may be deposited into the fund, see 46 CFR 390.7(d), and 50 CFR part 259.) For purposes of this paragraph, the term property does not include money.",
            "(ii) Whether or not the election provided for in paragraph (g)(2) of this section is made\u2014",
            "(a) The amount of any property deposit, and the fund's basis for property deposited in the fund, is the fair market value of the property at the time deposited, and",
            "(b) The fund's holding period for the property begins on the day after the deposit is made.",
            "(iii) Unless such an election is made, deposits of property into a fund are considered to be a sale at fair market value of the property, a deposit of cash equal to such fair market value, and a purchase by the fund of such property for cash. Thus, in the absence of the election, the difference between the fair market value of such property deposited and its adjusted basis shall be taken into account as gain or loss for purposes of computing the party's income tax liability for the year of deposit.",
            "(iv) For fund's basis and holding period of assets purchased by the fund, see paragraphs (d) (2) and (3) of this section.",
            "(2) Election not to treat deposits of property other than money as a sale or exchange at the time of deposit. A party may elect to treat a deposit of property as if no sale or other taxable event had occurred on the date of deposit. If such election is made, in the taxable year the fund disposes of the property, the party shall recognize as gain or loss the amount he would have recognized on the day the property was deposited into the fund had the election not been made. The party's holding period with respect to such property shall not include the period of time such property was held by the fund. The election shall be made by a statement to that effect, attached to the party's Federal income tax return for the taxable year to which the deposit relates, or, if such return is filed before such deposit is made, attached to the party's return for the taxable year during which the deposit is actually made.",
            "(3) Effect of qualified withdrawal of property deposited pursuant to election. If property deposited into a fund, with respect to which an election under paragraph (g)(2) of this section is made, is withdrawn from the fund in a qualified withdrawal (as defined in \u00a7 391.5) such withdrawal is treated as a disposition of such property resulting in recognition by the party of gain or loss (if any) as provided in paragraph (g)(2) of this section with respect to nonfund property. In addition, such withdrawal is treated as a disposition of such property by the fund resulting in recognition of gain or loss by the party with respect to fund property to the extent the fair market value of the property on the date of withdrawal is greater or less (as the case may be) than the adjusted basis of the property to the fund on such date. For purposes of determining the amount by which the balance within a particular account will be reduced in the manner provided in \u00a7 391.6(b) (relating to order of application of qualified withdrawals against accounts and for purposes of determining the reduction in basis of a vessel, barge, or container (or share therein) pursuant to \u00a7 391.6(c), the value of the property is its fair market value on the day of the qualified withdrawal. For rules relating to the effect of a qualified withdrawal of property purchased by the fund (including deposited property considered under paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of this section as purchased by the fund), see paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section.",
            "(4) Effect of nonqualified withdrawal of property deposited pursuant to election. If property deposited into a fund with respect to which an election under paragraph (g)(2) of this section is made, is withdrawn from the fund in a nonqualified withdrawal (as defined in \u00a7 391.7(b)), no gain or loss is to be recognized by the party with respect to fund property or nonfund property but an amount equal to the adjusted basis of the property to the fund is to be treated as a nonqualified withdrawal. Thus, such amount is to be applied against the various accounts in the manner provided in \u00a7 391.7(c), such amount is to be taken into account in computing the party's taxable income as provided in \u00a7 391.7(d), and such amount is to be subject to interest to the extent provided for in \u00a7 391.7(e). In the case of withdrawals to which this subparagraph applies, the adjusted basis of the property in the hands of the party is the adjusted basis on the date of deposit, increased or decreased by the adjustments made to such property while held in the fund, and in determining the period for which the party has held the property there shall be included, in addition to the period the fund held the property, the period for which the party held the property before the date of deposit of the property into the fund. For rules relating to the basis and holding period of property purchased by the fund (including deposited property considered under paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section as purchased by the fund) and withdrawn in a nonqualified withdrawal see \u00a7 391.7(f).",

Section 607 (d)(1)(A) of the Act provides that taxable income of the party (determined without regard to section 607 of the Act) shall be reduced by an amount equal to the amount deposited for the taxable year out of amounts referred to in section 607(b)(1)(A) of the Act and \u00a7 391.2(a)(1)(i). For computation of the foreign tax credit, see paragraph (i) of this section.",
            "(2) Net proceeds from agreement vessels and fund earnings. (i)(a) Section 607(d)(1)(B) provides that gain from a transaction referred to in section 607(b)(1)(C) of the Act and \u00a7 391.2(a)(1)(iii) (relating to ceilings on deposits of net proceeds from the sale or other disposition of agreement vessels) is not to be taken into account for purposes of the Code if an amount equal to the net proceeds from transactions referred to in such sections is deposited in the fund. Such gain is to be excluded from gross income of the party for the taxable year to which such deposit relates. Thus, the gain will not be taken into account in applying section 1231 of the Code for the year to which the deposit relates.",

            "(ii)(a) Section 607(d)(1)(C) of the Act provides that the earnings (including gains and losses) from the investment and reinvestment of amounts held in the fund and referred to in section 607(b)(1)(D) of the Act and \u00a7 391.2(a)(1)(iv) shall not be taken into account for purposes of the Code if an amount equal to such earnings is deposited into the fund. Such earnings are to be excluded from the gross income of the party for the taxable year to which such deposit relates.",
            "(b) However, for purposes of the basis adjustment under section 1232(a)(3)(E) of the Code, the ratable monthly portion of original issue discount included in gross income shall be determined without regard to section 607(d)(1)(C) of the Act.",
            "(iii) In determining the tax liability of a party to whom paragraph (b)(1) of this section applies, taxable income, determined after application of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, is in effect reduced by the portion of deposits which represent gain or earnings respectively referred to in paragraph (b)(2) (i) or (ii) of this section. The excess, if any, of such portion over taxable income determined after application of paragraph (b)(1) of this section is taken into account in computing the net operating loss (under section 172 of the Code) for the taxable year to which such deposits relate.",
            "(3) Time for making deposits. (i) This section applies with respect to an amount only if such amount is deposited in the fund pursuant to the agreement and not later than the time provided in paragraph (b)(2) (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section for the making of such deposit or the date the Secretary of Transportation provides, whichever is earlier.",

            "(iii) If the party is a subsidized operator under an operating-differential subsidy contract, and does not receive on or before the 59th day preceding such last day, payment of all or part of the accrued operating-differential subsidy payable for the taxable year, the party may deposit an amount equivalent to the unpaid accrued operating-differential subsidy on or before the 60th day after receipt of payment of the accrued operating-differential subsidy.",
            "(iv) A deposit pursuant to \u00a7 391.2(a)(3)(i) (relating to underdeposits caused by audit adjustments) must be made on or before the date prescribed for such a deposit in \u00a7 391.2(a)(4).",

            "(c) Determination of earnings and profits. [Reserved]",
            "(d) Accumulated earnings tax. As provided in section 607(d)(1)(E) of the Act amounts, while held in the fund, are not to be taken into account in computing the \u201caccumulated taxable income\u201d of the party within the meaning of section 531 of the Code. Amounts while held in the fund are considered held for the purpose of acquiring, constructing, or reconstructing a qualified vessel or barges and containers which are part of the complement of a qualified vessel or the payment of the principal on indebtedness incurred in connection with any such acquisition, construction, or reconstruction. Thus, for example, if the reasonable needs of the business (within the meaning of section 537 of the Code) justify a greater amount of accumulation for providing replacement vessels than can be satisfied out of the fund, such greater amount accumulated outside of the fund shall be considered to be accumulated for the reasonable needs of the business. For a further example, although amounts in the fund are not taken into account in applying the tax imposed by section 531 of the Code, to the extent there are amounts in a fund to provide for replacing a vessel, amounts accumulated outside of the fund to replace the same vessel are not considered to be accumulated for the reasonable needs of the business.",
            "(e) Nonapplicability of section 1231. If an amount equivalent to gain from a transaction referred to in section 607(b)(1)(C) of the Act and \u00a7 391.2(c) (1) and (5) is deposited into the fund and, therefore, such gain is not taken into account in computing gross income under the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, then such gain will not be taken into account for purposes of the computations under section 1231 of the Code.",
            "(f) Deposits of capital gains. In respect of capital gains which are not included in the gross income of the party by virtue of a deposit to which section 607(d) of the Act and this section apply, the following provisions of the Code do not apply; the minimum tax for tax preferences imposed by section 56 of the Code; the alternative tax imposed by section 1201 of the Code on the excess of the party's net long-term capital gain over his net short-term capital loss; and, in the case of a taxpayer other than a corporation, the deduction provided by section 1202 of the Code of 50 percent of the amount of such excess. However, section 56 may apply upon a nonqualified withdrawal with respect to amounts treated under \u00a7 391.7(d)(2) as being made out of the capital gain account.",
            "(g) Deposits of dividends. The deduction provided by section 243 of the Code (relating to the deductions for dividends from a domestic corporation received by a corporation) shall not apply in respect of dividends (earned on assets held in the fund) which are deposited into a fund, and which, by virtue of such deposits and the provisions of section 607(d) of the Act and this section, are not included in the gross income of the party.",
            "(h) Presumption of validity of deposit. All amounts deposited in the fund shall be presumed to have been deposited pursuant to an agreement unless, after an examination of the facts upon the request of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue or his delegate, the Secretary of Transportation determines otherwise. The Commissioner or his delegate will request such a determination where there is a substantial question as to whether a deposit is made in accordance with an agreement.",
            "(i) Special rules for application of the foreign tax credit\u2014(1) In general. For purposes of computing the limitation under section 904 of the Code on the amount of the credit provided by section 901 of the Code (relating to the foreign tax credit), the party's taxable income from any source without the United States and the party's entire taxable income are to be determined after application of section 607(d) of the Act. Thus, amounts deposited for the taxable year with respect to amounts referred to in section 607(b)(1)(A) of the Act and \u00a7 391.2(a)(1)(i) (relating to taxable income attributable to the operation of agreement vessels) shall be treated as a deduction in arriving at the party's taxable income from sources without the United States (subject to the apportionment rules and paragraph (i)(2) of this section) and the party's entire taxable income for the taxable year. Amounts deposited with respect to gain described in section 607(d)(1)(B) of the Act and \u00a7 391.2(c) (relating to net proceeds from the sale or other disposition of an agreement vessel and net proceeds from insurance or indemnity) and amounts deposited with respect to earnings described in section 607(d)(1)(C) of the Act and paragraph (b)(2)(ii) (relating to earnings from the investment and reinvestment of amounts held in a fund) of this section are not taken into account for purposes of the Code and hence are not included in the party's taxable income from sources without the United States or in the party's entire taxable income for purposes of this paragraph.",
            "(2) Apportionment of taxable income attributable to agreement vessels. For purposes of computing the overall limitation under section 904(a)(2) of the Code the amount of the deposit made with respect to taxable income attributable to agreement vessels pursuant to \u00a7 391.2(a)(1)(i) which is allocable to sources without the United States is the total amount of such deposit multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the gross income from sources without the United States from the operation of agreement vessels and the denominator of which is the total gross income from the operation of agreement vessels computed as provided in \u00a7 391.2(b)(2). For purposes of this paragraph, gross income from sources without the United States attributable to the operation of agreement vessels is to be determined under sections 61 through 863 of the Code and under the taxpayer's usual method of accounting provided such method is reasonable and in keeping with sound accounting practice. Any computation under the per-country limitation of section 904(a)(1) shall be made in the manner consistent with the provisions of the preceding sentences of this paragraph."

The net long-term capital loss of the fund for the taxable year shall reduce the earliest long-term capital gains in the capital gain account at the beginning of the taxable year and the next short-term capital loss for the taxable year shall reduce the earliest short-term capital gains remaining in the ordinary income account at the beginning of the taxable year. Any such losses that are in excess of the capital gains in the respective accounts shall reduce capital gains deposited into the respective accounts in subsequent years (without regard to section 1212, relating to capital loss carrybacks and carryovers). On termination of a fund, any net long-term capital loss in the capital gain account and any net short-term capital loss remaining in the ordinary income accounts is to be taken into account for purposes of computing the party's taxable income for the year of termination as a long-term or short-term (as the case may be) capital loss recognized in the year the fund is terminated.

(1) A qualified withdrawal is one made from the fund during the taxable year which is in accordance with section 670(f)(1) of the Act, the agreement, and with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Transportation and which is for the acquisition, construction, or reconstruction of a qualified vessel (as defined in \u00a7 391.11(a)(2)) or barges and containers which are part of the complement of a qualified vessel (or shares in such vessels, barges, and containers), or for the payment of the principal of indebtedness incurred in connection with the acquisition construction, or reconstruction of such qualified vessel (or a barge or container which is part of the complement of a qualified vessel).",
            "(2) For purposes of this section the term share is used to reflect an interest in a vessel and means a proprietary interest in a vessel such as, for example, that which results from joint ownership. Accordingly, a share within the meaning of \u00a7 391.2(f) (relating to the definition of \u201cagreement vessel\u201d for the purpose of making deposits) will not necessarily be sufficient to be treated as a share within the meaning of this section.",

            "(i) Any acquisition, but only to the extent the basis of the property acquired in the hands of the transferee is its cost. Thus, for example, if a party transfers a vessel and $1 million in an exchange for another vessel which qualifies for nonrecognition of gain or loss under section 1031(a) of the Code (relating to like-kind exchange), there is an acquisition to the extent of $1 million.",

            "(b) Payments on indebtedness. Payments on indebtedness may constitute qualified withdrawals only if the party shows to the satisfaction of the Secretary of Transportation a direct connection between incurring the indebtedness and the acquisition, construction, or reconstruction of a qualified vessel or its complement of barges and containers whether or not the indebtedness is secured by the vessel or its complement of barges and containers. The fact that an indebtedness is secured by an interest in a qualified vessel, barge, or container is insufficient by itself to demonstrate the necessary connection.",

Not- withstanding paragraph (a) of this section, payments from a fund to a person owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the same interests as the party within the meaning of section 482 of the Code and the regulations thereunder are not to be treated as qualified withdrawals unless the party demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary of Transportation that no part of such payment constitutes a dividend, a return of capital, or a contribution to capital under the Code.",
            "(d) Treatment of fund upon failure to fulfill obligations. Section 607(f)(2) of the Act provides that if the Secretary of Transportation determines that any substantial obligation under the agreement is not being fulfilled, he may, after notice and opportunity for hearing to the party, treat the entire fund, or any portion thereof, as having been withdrawn as a nonqualified withdrawal. In determining whether a party has breached a substantial obligation under the agreement, the Secretary will consider among other things, (1) the effect of the party's action or omission upon his ability to carry out the purposes of the fund and for which qualified withdrawals are permitted under section 607(f)(1) of the Act, and (2) whether the party has made material misrepresentations in connection with the agreement or has failed to disclose material information.

If the aggregate amount of such withdrawal from the ordinary income account and capital gain account would cause a basis reduction in excess of the party's basis in such vessel, barge, or container (or share therein), the excess is applied against the basis of other vessels, barges, or containers (or shares therein) owned by the party at the time of withdrawal in the following order: (i) Vessels, barges, or containers (or shares therein) which were the subject of qualified withdrawals in the order in which they were acquired, constructed, or reconstructed; (ii) agreement vessels (as defined in section 607(k)(3) of the Act and \u00a7 391.11(a)(3)) and barges and containers which are part of the complement of an agreement vessel (or shares therein) which were not the subject of qualified withdrawals, in the order in which such vessels, barges, or containers (or shares therein) were acquired by the party; and (iii) other vessels, barges, and containers (or shares therein), in the order in which they were acquired by the party. Any amount of a withdrawal remaining after the application of this paragraph is to be treated as a nonqualified withdrawal. If the indebtedness was incurred to acquire two or more vessels, barges, or containers (or shares therein), then the basis reduction in such vessels, barges, or containers (or shares therein) is to be made pro rata in proportion to the adjusted basis of such vessels, barges, or containers (or shares therein) computed, however, without regard to this section and adjustments under section 1016(a) (2) and (3) of the Code for depreciation or amortization.",
            "(d) Basis for depreciation. For purposes of determining the allowance for depreciation under section 167 of the Code in respect of any property which has been acquired, constructed, or reconstructed from qualified withdrawals, the adjusted basis for determining gain on such property is determined after applying paragraph (c) of this section. In the case of reductions in the basis of any property resulting from the application of paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the party may adopt a method of accounting whereby (1) payments shall reduce the basis of the property on the day such payments are actually made, or (2) payments made at any time during the first half of the party's taxable year shall reduce the basis of the property on the first day of the taxable year, and payments made at any time during the second half of the party's taxable year shall reduce the basis of the property on the first day of the succeeding taxable year. For requirements respecting the change of methods of accounting, see \u00a7 1.446-1(e)(3) of the Income Tax Regulations of this chapter.",

          "paragraphs": [
            "(a) In general. Section 607(h) of the Act provides rules for the tax treatment of nonqualified withdrawals, including rules for adjustments to the various accounts of the fund, the inclusion of amounts in income, and the payment of interest with respect to such amounts.",
            "(b) Nonqualified withdrawals defined. Except as provided in section 607 of the Act and \u00a7 391.8 (relating to certain corporate reorganizations, changes in partnerships, and transfers by reason of death), any withdrawal from a fund which is not a qualified withdrawal shall be treated as a nonqualified withdrawal which is subject to tax in accordance with section 607(h) of the Act and the provisions of this section. Examples of nonqualified withdrawals are amounts remaining in a fund upon termination of the fund, and withdrawals which are treated as nonqualified withdrawals under section 607(f)(2) of the Act and \u00a7 391.5(d) (relating to failure by a party to fulfill substantial obligation under agreement) or under the second sentence of section 607(g)(4) of the Act and \u00a7 391.6(c)(3) (relating to payments against indebtedness in excess of basis).",
            "(c) Order of application of nonqualified withdrawals against deposits. A nonqualified withdrawal from a fund shall be treated as being made: First, out of the ordinary income account; second, out of the capital gain account; and third, out of the capital account. Such withdrawals will reduce the balance within a particular account on a first-in-first-out basis, the earliest nonqualified withdrawals reducing the items within an account in the order in which they were actually deposited or deemed deposited in accordance with this part. Nonqualified withdrawals for research, development, and design expenses incident to new and advanced ship design, machinery, and equipment, and any amount treated as a nonqualified withdrawal under the second sentence of section 607(g)(4) of the Act and \u00a7 391.6(c)(3), shall be applied against the deposits within a particular account on a last-in-first-out basis. The date funds are actually withdrawn from the fund determines the time at which withdrawals are considered to be made. For special rules concerning the withdrawal of contingent deposits of net proceeds from the installment sale of an agreement vessel, see \u00a7 391.2(c)(6).",
            "(d) Inclusion in income. (1) Any portion of a nonqualified withdrawal which, under paragraph (c) of this section, is treated as being made out of the ordinary income account is to be included in gross income as an item of ordinary income for the taxable year in which the withdrawal is made.",
            "(2) Any portion of a nonqualified withdrawal which, under paragraph (c) of this section, is treated as being made out of the capital gain account is to be included in income as an item of long-term capital gain recognized during the taxable year in which the withdrawal is made.",
            "(3) For effect upon a party's taxable income of capital losses remaining in a fund upon the termination of a fund (which, under paragraph (b) of this section, is treated as a nonqualified withdrawal of amounts remaining in the fund), see \u00a7 391.4(e).",
            "(e) Interest. (1) For the period on or before the last date prescribed by law, including extensions thereof, for filing the party's Federal income tax return for the taxable year during which a nonqualified withdrawal is made, no interest shall be payable under section 6601 of the Code in respect of the tax on any item which is included in gross income under paragraph (d) of this section, and no addition to such tax for such period shall be payable under section 6651 of the Code. In lieu of the interest and additions to tax under such sections, simple interest on the amount of the tax attributable to any item included in gross income under paragraph (d) of this section is to be paid at the rate of interest determined for the year of withdrawal under paragraph (e)(2) of this section. Such interest is to be charged for the period from the last date prescribed for payment of tax for the taxable year for which such item was deposited in the fund to the last date for payment of tax for the taxable year in which the withdrawal is made. Both dates are to be determined without regard to any extensions of time for payment. Interest determined under this paragraph which is paid within the taxable year shall be allowed as a deduction for such year under section 163 of the Code. However, such interest is to be treated as part of the party's tax for the year of withdrawal for purposes of collection and in determining any interest or additions to tax for the year of withdrawal under section 6601 or 6651, respectively, of the Code.",
            "(2) For purposes of section 607(h)(3)(C)(ii) of the Act, and for purposes of certain dispositions of vessels constructed, reconstructed, or acquired with qualified withdrawals described in \u00a7 391.6(e), the applicable rate of interest for any nonqualified withdrawal\u2014",
            "(i) Made in a taxable year beginning in 1970 and 1971 is 8 percent.",
            "(ii) Made in a taxable year beginning after 1971, the rate for such year as determined and published jointly by the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate and the Secretary of Transportation. Such rate shall bear a relationship to 8 percent which the Secretaries determine to be comparable to the relationship which the money rates and investment yields for the calendar year immediately preceding the beginning of the taxable year bear to the money rates and investment yields for the calendar year 1970. The determination of the applicable rate for any such taxable year will be computed by multiplying 8 percent by the ratio which (a) the average yield on 5-year Treasury securities for the calendar year immediately preceding the beginning of such taxable year, bears to (b) the average yield on 5-year Treasury securities for the calendar year 1970. The applicable rate so determined shall be computed to the nearest one-hundredth of 1 percent. If such a determination and publication is made, the latest published percentage shall apply for any taxable year beginning in the calendar year with respect to which publication is made.",
            "(3) No interest shall be payable in respect of taxes on amounts referred to in section 607(h)(2) (i) and (ii) of the Act (relating to withdrawals for research and development and payments against indebtedness in excess of basis) or in the case of any nonqualified withdrawal arising from the application of the recapture provision of section 606(5) of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as in effect on December 31, 1969.",
            "(f) Basis and holding period in the case of property purchased by the fund or considered purchased by the fund. In the case of a nonqualified withdrawal of property other than money which was purchased by the fund (including deposited property considered under \u00a7 391.2 (g)(1)(ii) as purchased by the fund), the adjusted basis of the property in the hands of the party is its adjusted basis to the fund on the day of the withdrawal. In determining the period for which the taxpayer has held the property withdrawn in a nonqualified withdrawal, there shall be included only the period beginning with the date on which the withdrawal occurred. For basis and holding period in the case of nonqualified withdrawals of property other than money deposited into the fund, see \u00a7 391.2(g)(4)."

If an agreement to establish a new fund is extended to amounts from an old fund, each item in the old fund to which such agreement applies shall be considered to be transferred to the appropriate account in the manner provided for in \u00a7 391.8(d) in the new fund in a nontaxable transaction which is in accordance with the provisions of the agreement under which such old fund was maintained. For purposes of determining the amount of interest under section 607(h)(3)(C) of the Act and \u00a7 391.7(e), the date of deposit of any item so transferred shall be deemed to be July 1, 1971, or the date of the deposit in the old fund, whichever is the later."
