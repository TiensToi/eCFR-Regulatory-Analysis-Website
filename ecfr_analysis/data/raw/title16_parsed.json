Except as provided in paragraph (e)(7) of this section, administrative disciplinary proceedings shall be handled in accordance with the following procedures:",

The order to show cause shall be accompanied by all declarations, deposition transcripts, or other evidence the staff wishes the Commission to consider in support of the allegations of misconduct.",
            "(ii) Within 14 days of service of the order to show cause, the respondent may file a response to the allegations of misconduct. If the response disputes any of the allegations of misconduct, it shall do so with specificity and include all materials the respondent wishes the Commission to consider relating to the allegations. If no response is filed, the allegations shall be deemed admitted.",

The Commission order shall specify the nature and scope of any proceeding, including whether live testimony will be heard and whether any pre-hearing discovery will be allowed and if so to what extent. The attorney respondent shall be granted due opportunity to be heard in his or her own defense and may be represented by counsel. If the written submissions of the respondent raise no genuine dispute of material fact, the Commission may issue immediately any or all of the sanctions enumerated in the order to show cause provided for in paragraph (e)(5)(i) of this section.",

An Administrative Law Judge's decision may be appealed to the Commission by either party within 30 days. If the Administrative Law Judge's decision is appealed, the Commission will thereafter issue a scheduling order governing the appeal.",
            "(vii) Investigations and administrative proceedings prior to the hearing on the order to show cause will be nonpublic unless otherwise ordered by the Commission. Any administrative hearing on the order to show cause, and any oral argument on appeal, shall be open to the public unless otherwise ordered for good cause by the Commission or the Administrative Law Judge.",
            "(6) Regardless of any action or determination the Commission may or may not make, the Commission may direct the General Counsel to refer the allegations of misconduct to the appropriate state, territory, or District of Columbia bar or any other appropriate authority for further action.",
            "(7) Upon receipt of notification from any authority having power to suspend or disbar an attorney from the practice of law within any state, territory, or the District of Columbia, demonstrating that an attorney practicing before the Commission is subject to an order of final suspension (not merely temporary suspension pending further action) or disbarment by such authority, the Commission may, without resort to any of the procedures described in this section, enter an order temporarily suspending the attorney from practice before it and directing the attorney to show cause within 30 days from the date of said order why the Commission should not impose further discipline against the attorney. If no response is filed, the attorney will be deemed to have acceded to such further discipline as the Commission deems appropriate. If a response is received, the Commission may take action or initiate proceedings consistent with paragraph (e)(5) of this section before making a determination whether, and to what extent, to impose further discipline against the attorney.",
            "(8) The disciplinary process described in this section is in addition to, and does not supersede, the authority of the Commission or an Administrative Law Judge to discipline attorneys participating in part 3 proceedings pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 3.24(b)(2) or 3.42(d)."

            "(a) Definitions. For purposes of this section, ex parte communication means an oral or written communication not on the public record with respect to which reasonable prior notice to all parties is not given, but it shall not include requests for status reports on any matter or proceeding.",
            "(b) Prohibited ex parte communications. While a proceeding is in adjudicative status within the Commission, except to the extent required for the disposition of ex parte matters as authorized by law:",
            "(1) No person not employed by the Commission, and no employee or agent of the Commission who performs investigative or prosecuting functions in adjudicative proceedings, shall make or knowingly cause to be made to any member of the Commission, or to the Administrative Law Judge, or to any other employee who is or who reasonably may be expected to be involved in the decisional process in the proceeding, an ex parte communciation relevant to the merits of that or a factually related proceeding; and",
            "(2) No member of the Commission, the Administrative Law Judge, or any other employee who is or who reasonably may be expected to be involved in the decisional process in the proceeding, shall make or knowingly cause to be made to any person not employed by the Commission, or to any employee or agent of the Commission who performs investigative or prosecuting functions in adjudicative proceedings, an ex parte communication relevant to the merits of that or a factually related proceeding.",
            "(c) Procedures. A Commissioner, the Administrative Law Judge or any other employee who is or who may reasonably be expected to be involved in the decisional process who receives or who make or knowingly causes to be made, a communication prohibited by paragraph (b) of this section shall promptly provide to the Secretary of the Commission:",
            "(1) All such written communications;",
            "(2) Memoranda stating the substance of and circumstances of all such oral communications; and",
            "(3) All written responses, and memoranda stating the substance of all oral responses, to the materials described in paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section. The Secretary shall make relevant portions of any such materials part of the public record of the Commission, pursuant to \u00a7 4.9, and place them in the docket binder of the proceeding to which it pertains, but they will not be considered by the Commission as part of the record for purposes of decision unless introduced into evidence in the proceeding. The Secretary shall also send copies of the materials to or otherwise notify all parties to the proceeding.",
            "(d) Sanctions. (1) Upon receipt of an ex parte communication knowingly made or knowingly caused to be made by a party and prohibited by paragraph (b) of this section, the Commission, Administrative Law Judge, or other employee presiding over the proceeding may, to the extent consistent with the interests of justice and the policy of the underlying statutes administered by the Commission, require the party to show cause why his claim or interest in the proceeding should not be dismissed, denied, disregarded, or otherwise adversely affected on account of such violation. The Commission may take such action as it considers appropriate, including but not limited to, action under \u00a7 4.1(e)(2) and 5 U.S.C. 556(d).",
            "(2) A person, not a party to the proceeding who knowingly makes or causes to be made an ex parte communication prohibited by paragraph (b) of this section shall be subject to all sanctions provided herein if he subsequently becomes a party to the proceeding.",
            "(e) The prohibitions of this section shall apply in an adjudicative proceeding from the time the Commission votes to issue a complaint pursuant to \u00a7 3.11, to conduct adjudicative hearings pursuant to \u00a7 3.13, or to issue an order to show cause pursuant to \u00a7 3.72(b), or from the time an order by a U.S. court of appeals remanding a Commission decision and order for further proceedings becomes effective, until the time the Commission votes to enter its decision in the proceeding and the time permitted by \u00a7 3.55 to seek reconsideration of that decision has elapsed. For purposes of this section, an order of remand by a U.S. court of appeals shall be deemed to become effective when the Commission determines not to file a petition for a writ of certiorari, or when the time for filing such a petition has expired without a petition having been filed, or when such a petition has been denied. If a petition for reconsideration of a Commission decision is filed pursuant to \u00a7 3.55, the provisions of this section shall apply until the time the Commission votes to enter an order disposing of the petition. In addition, the prohibitions of this section shall apply with respect to communications concerning an application for stay filed with the Commission pursuant to \u00a7 3.56 from the time that the application is filed until its disposition.",
            "(f) The prohibitions of paragraph (b) of this section do not apply to a communication occasioned by and concerning a nonadjudicative function of the Commission, including such functions as the initiation, conduct, or disposition of a separate investigation, the issuance of a complaint, or the initiation of a rulemaking or other proceeding, whether or not it involves a party already in an adjudicative proceeding; preparations for judicial review of a Commission order; a proceeding outside the scope of \u00a7 3.2, including a matter in state or federal court or before another governmental agency; a nonadjudicative function of the Commission, including but not limited to an obligation under \u00a7 4.11 or a communication with Congress; or the disposition of a consent settlement under \u00a7 3.25 concerning some or all of the charges involved in a complaint and executed by some or all respondents. The Commission, at its discretion and under such restrictions as it may deem appropriate, may disclose to the public or to respondent(s) in a pending adjudicative proceeding a communication made exempt by this paragraph from the prohibitions of paragraph (b) of this section, however, when the Commission determines that the interests of justice would be served by the disclosure. The prohibitions of paragraph (b) of this section also do not apply to a communication between any member of the Commission, the Administrative Law Judge, or any other employee who is or who reasonably may be expected to be involved in the decisional process, and any employee who has been directed by the Commission or requested by an individual Commissioner or Administrative Law Judge to assist in the decision of the adjudicative proceeding. Such employee shall not, however, have performed an investigative or prosecuting function in that or a factually related proceeding."

          "heading": "\u00a7 4.8   Costs for obtaining Commission records.",
          "paragraphs": [
            "(a) Definitions. For the purpose of this section:",
            "(1) The term search includes all time spent looking, manually or by automated means, for material that is responsive to a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line identification of material within documents.",
            "(2) The term duplication refers to the process of making a copy of a document for the purpose of releasing that document in response to a request for Commission records. Such copies can take the form of paper copy, microform, audio-visual materials, or machine readable documentation such as magnetic tape or computer disc. For copies prepared by computer and then saved to a computer disc, the Commission charges the direct costs, including operator time, of production of the disc or other output format. Where paper documents must be scanned in order to comply with a requester's preference to receive the records in an electronic format, the requester shall pay the direct costs associated with scanning those materials. As set out in \u00a7 4.8(b), certain requesters do not pay for direct costs associated with duplicating the first 100 pages.",
            "(3) The term review refers to the examination of documents located in response to a request to determine whether any portion of such documents may be withheld, and the redaction or other processing of documents for disclosure. Review costs are recoverable from commercial use requesters even if a record ultimately is not disclosed. Review time includes time spent considering formal objections to disclosure made by a business submitter but does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the release of the document.",
            "(4) The term direct costs means expenditures that the Commission actually incurs in processing requests. Direct costs include the salary of the employee performing work (the basic rate of pay for the employee plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating duplicating machinery. Not included in direct costs are overhead expenses such as costs of document review facilities or the costs of heating or lighting such a facility or other facilities in which records are stored. The direct costs of specific services are set forth in \u00a7 4.8(b)(6).",
            "(b) Fees. User fees pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 9701 and 5 U.S.C. 552(a) shall be charged according to this paragraph, unless the requester establishes the applicability of a public interest fee waiver pursuant to \u00a7 4.8(e). The chart summarizes the types of charges that apply to requester categories set out in paragraphs (b)(1)-(b)(3).",
            "(1) Commercial use requesters. Commercial use requesters will be charged for the direct costs to search for, review, and duplicate documents. A commercial use requester is a requester who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or the person on whose behalf the request is made.",
            "(2) Educational requesters, non-commercial scientific institution requesters, and representative of the news media. Requesters in these categories will be charged for the direct costs to duplicate documents, excluding charges for the first 100 pages.",
            "(i) An educational institution is a preschool, a public or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of graduate higher education, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an institution of professional education, and an institution of vocational education, which operates a program or programs of scholarly research. To be in this category, a requester must show that the request is authorized by and is made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are sought to further the scholarly research of the institution and are not sought for a commercial or an individual use or goal.",
            "(ii) A non-commercial scientific institution is an institution that is not operated on a commercial basis as that term is referenced in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and that is operated solely to conduct scientific research the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry.",
            "(iii) A representative of the news media is any person or entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. The term \u201cnews\u201d means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large and publishers of periodicals (but only in those instances where they can qualify as disseminators of news) who make their products available for purchase by or subscription by the general public or free distribution to the general public. These examples are not intended to be all-inclusive. As traditional methods of news delivery evolve (e.g., electronic dissemination of newspapers through telecommunications services), such alternative media shall be considered to be news-media entities. A freelance journalist shall be regarded as working for a news-media entity if the journalist can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that entity, whether or not the journalist is actually employed by the entity. A publication contract would provide a solid basis for such an expectation, but the past publication record of a requester may also be considered in making such a determination. To qualify for news media status, a request must not be for a nonjournalistic commercial use. A request for records supporting the news dissemination function of the requester is not considered a commercial use.",
            "(3) Other requesters. Other requesters not described in paragraphs (b)(1) or (2) will be charged for the direct costs to search for and duplicate documents, except that the first 100 pages of duplication and the first two hours of search time shall be furnished without charge.",
            "(4) Waiver of small charges. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (b)(1), (2), and (3) of this section, charges will be waived if the total chargeable fees for a request are under $25.00.",
            "(5) Materials available without charge. These provisions do not apply to public records, including but not limited to Commission decisions, orders, and other public materials that may be made available to all requesters without charge.",
            "(6)(i) Schedule of direct costs. The following uniform schedule of fees applies to records held by all constituent units of the Commission:",
            "(ii) Search, review and duplication fees. Agency staff is divided into three categories: Clerical, attorney/economist, and other professional. Fees for search and review purposes, as well the costs of operating duplication machinery such as converting paper to electronic format (scanning), are assessed on a quarter-hourly basis, and are determined by identifying the category into which the staff member(s) conducting the search or review or duplication procedure belong(s), determining the average quarter-hourly wages of all staff members within that category, and adding 16 percent to reflect the cost of additional benefits accorded to government employees. The exact fees are calculated and announced periodically and are available from the Consumer Response Center, Federal Trade Commission, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20580; (202) 326-2222.",
            "(7) Untimely responses. (i) Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(7)(ii)-(iv) of this section, search fees for responding to a Freedom of Information Act request will not be assessed for responses that fail to comply with the time limits, as provided at 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(A)(viii), \u00a7 4.11(a)(1)(ii) and \u00a7 4.11(a)(3)(ii), if there are no unusual or exceptional circumstances, as those terms are defined by 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6) and \u00a7 4.11(a)(1)(ii). Except as provided below, duplication fees will not be assessed for an untimely response, where there are no unusual or exceptional circumstances, made to a requester qualifying for one of the fee categories set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.",
            "(ii) If the Commission has determined that unusual circumstances apply and has provided a timely written notice to the requester in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B), the delay in a response is excused for an additional 10 days. If the Commission fails to comply with the extended time limit, it will not charge search fees (or, for a requester qualifying for one of the fee categories set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, will not charge duplication fees).",
            "(iii) If the Commission has determined that unusual circumstances apply and more than 5,000 pages are necessary to respond to the request, the agency may charge search fees (or, for requesters qualifying for one of the fee categories set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, may charge duplication fees) if timely written notice has been provided to the requester and the agency has discussed with the requester via written mail, electronic mail, or telephone (or made not less than 3 good-faith attempts to do so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request.",
            "(iv) If a court determines that exceptional circumstances exist, the Commission's failure to comply with a time limit shall be excused for the length of time provided by the court order.",
            "(c) Information to determine fees. Each request for records shall set forth whether the request is made for either commercial or non-commercial purposes or whether the requester is an educational institution, a noncommercial scientific institution, or a representative of the news media. The deciding official (as designated by the General Counsel) will use this information, any additional information provided by the requester, and any other relevant information to determine the appropriate fee category in which to place the requester. See \u00a7 4.11(a)(3)(i)(A)(3) for procedures on appealing fee category and fee waiver determinations.",
            "(d) Agreement to pay fees. (1) Each request that does not contain an application for a fee waiver as set forth in \u00a7 4.8(e) shall specifically indicate that the requester will either:",
            "(i) Pay, in accordance with \u00a7 4.8(b), whatever fees may be charged for processing the request; or",
            "(ii) Pay such fees up to a specified amount, whereby the processing of the request would cease once the specified amount has been reached.",
            "(2) Each request that contains an application for a fee waiver shall specifically indicate whether the requester, in the case that the fee waiver is not granted, will:",
            "(i) Pay, in accordance with \u00a7 4.8(b), whatever fees may be charged for processing the request;",
            "(ii) Pay fees up to a specified amount, whereby the processing of the request would cease once the specified amount has been reached; or",
            "(iii) Not pay fees, whereby the processing of the request will cease at the point fees are to be incurred in accordance with \u00a7 4.8(b).",
            "(3) If the agreement required by this section is absent, and if the estimated fees exceed $25.00, the requester will be advised of the estimated fees and the request will not be processed until the requester agrees to pay such fees. If the requester does not respond to the notification that the estimated fees exceed $25.00 within 20 calendar days from the date of the notification, the request will be closed.",
            "(e) Public interest fee waivers\u2014(1) Procedures. A requester may apply for a waiver of fees. The requester shall explain in sufficient detail why a waiver is appropriate under the standards set forth in this paragraph. The application shall also include a statement, as provided by paragraph (d) of this section, of whether the requester agrees to pay costs if the waiver is denied. The deciding official (as designated by the General Counsel) will rule on applications for fee waivers. To appeal the deciding official's determination of the fee waiver, a requester must follow the procedures set forth in \u00a7 4.11(a)(3).",
            "(2) Standards. (i) The first requirement for a fee waiver is that disclosure will likely contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government. This requirement shall be met if the requester establishes that:",
            "(A) The subject matter of the requested information concerns the operations or activities of the Federal government;",
            "(B) The disclosure is likely to contribute to an understanding of these operations or activities;",
            "(C) The understanding to which disclosure is likely to contribute is public understanding, as opposed to the understanding of the individual requester or a narrow segment of interested persons (e.g., by providing specific information about the requester's expertise in the subject area of the request and about the ability and intention to disseminate the information to the public); and",
            "(D) The likely contribution to public understanding will be significant.",
            "(ii) The second requirement for a fee waiver is that the request not be primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. This requirement shall be met if the requester shows either:",
            "(A) That the requester does not have a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure; or",
            "(B) If the requester does have a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure, that the public interest in disclosure outweighs the identified commercial interest of the requester so that the disclosure is not primarily in the requester's commercial interest.",
            "(f) Searches that do not yield responsive records. Charges may be assessed for search time even if the agency fails to locate any responsive records or if it locates only records that are determined to be exempt from disclosure.",
            "(g) Aggregating requests. If the deciding official (as designated by the General Counsel) initially, or the General Counsel on appeal, reasonably believes that a requester, or a group of requesters acting in concert, is attempting to evade an assessment of fees by dividing a single request into a series of smaller requests, the requests may be aggregated and fees charged accordingly.",
            "(h) Advance payment. If the deciding official (as designated by the General Counsel) initially, or the General Counsel on appeal, estimates or determines that allowable charges that a requester may be required to pay are likely to exceed $250.00, or if the requester has previously failed to pay a fee within 30 days of the date of billing, the requester may be required to pay some or all of the total estimated charge in advance. Further, the requester may be required to pay all unpaid bills, including accrued interest, prior to processing the request.",
            "(i) Means of payment. Payment shall be made either electronically through the Department of Treasury's pay.gov Web site or by check or money order payable to the Treasury of the United States.",
            "(j) Interest charges. The Commission will begin assessing interest charges on an unpaid bill starting on the 31st day following the day on which the bill was sent. Interest will accrue from the date of the billing, and will be calculated at the rate prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 3717.",
            "(k) Effect of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365), as amended by the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-134). The Commission will pursue repayment, where appropriate, by employing the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982, as amended by the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, the Federal Claims Collection Standards (FCSS), 31 CFR 900-904, and any other applicable authorities in collecting unpaid fees assessed under this section, including disclosure to consumer reporting agencies and use of collection agencies. The FTC also reserves the legal right to employ other lawful debt collection methods such as alternative dispute resolution and arbitration when appropriate."

Any person may request copies of such records by contacting the FTC Reading Room by telephone at (202) 326-2222, extension 2. These requests shall specify as clearly and accurately as reasonably possible the records desired. For records that cannot be specified with complete clarity and particularity, requesters shall provide descriptions sufficient to enable qualified Commission personnel to locate the records sought. The Commission, the Supervisor of the Consumer Response Center, the General Counsel, or the deciding official (as designated by the General Counsel) may decide to provide only one copy of any public record and may refuse to provide copies to the requester if the records have been published or are publicly available at places other than the Commission's offices.",
            "(ii) Costs; agreement to pay costs. Requesters will be charged search and duplication costs prescribed by Rule 4.8 for requests under this section.

(A) A request under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended, for access to Commission records shall be in writing and transmitted by one of the following means: by the form located on the FTC's FOIA Web site, found at www.ftc.gov; by email message to the FOIA email account at foia@ftc.gov; by facsimile transmission to (202) 326-2477; or by mail to the following address: Freedom of Information Act Request, Office of the General Counsel, Federal Trade Commission, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20580.",
            "(B) Failure to mark the envelope and the request in accordance with paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) of this section, or the filing of a request for expedited treatment under paragraph (a)(1)(i)(G) of this section, will result in the request (or requests, if expedited treatment has been requested) as received on the date that the processing unit in the Office of General Counsel actually receives the request(s).",
            "(C) Acknowledgment of requests. Once a FOIA request is properly received by the processing unit in the Office of the General Counsel, a letter acknowledging the receipt of the request shall be mailed to the requester if processing the request will likely take more than 5 business days.",
            "(D) Identifiability. (1) A properly filed FOIA request shall reasonably describe the records sought with enough detail to enable the Commission to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort. Whenever possible, the request should include specific information about each record sought such as date, title, name, author, recipient, subject matter of the record, provide information regarding fees pursuant to \u00a7 4.8(c), and provide sufficient contact information for a response to be sent. Although a mailing address is generally required, an email address can suffice in some instances. The FOIA Office will consider requests to send responses by email.",
            "(2) A denial of a request may state that the description required by paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(A) of this section is insufficient to allow identification and location of the records.",
            "(E) Costs; agreement to pay costs. Requesters will be charged search, review, duplication and other chargeable direct costs as prescribed by \u00a7 4.8 for requests under this section. All requests shall include a statement of the information needed to determine fees, as provided by \u00a7 4.8(c), and an agreement to pay fees (or a statement that the requester will not pay fees if a fee waiver is denied), as provided by \u00a7 4.8(d). Requests may also include an application for a fee waiver, as provided by \u00a7 4.8(e). An advance payment may be required in appropriate cases as provided by \u00a7 4.8(h).",
            "(F) Failure to agree to pay fees. If a request does not include an agreement to pay fees, and if the requester is notified of the estimated costs pursuant to \u00a7 4.8(d)(3), the request will be deemed not to have been received until the requester agrees to pay such fees. If a requester declines to pay fees within 20 calendar days and is not granted a fee waiver, the request will be denied.",
            "(G) Expedited treatment. Requests may include an application for expedited treatment. Where such an application is not included with an initial request for access to records under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the application may be included in any appeal of that request filed under paragraph (a)(3) of this section. Such application, which shall be certified by the requester to be true and correct to the best of such person's knowledge and belief, shall describe the compelling need for expedited treatment, including an explanation as to why a failure to obtain the requested records on an expedited basis could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual, or, with respect to a request made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information, an explanation of the urgency to inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity. The deciding official (as designated by the General Counsel) will, within 10 calendar days of receipt of a request for expedited treatment, notify the requester, in writing, of the decision to either grant or deny the request for expedited treatment, and, if the request is denied, advise the requester that this determination may be appealed to the General Counsel.",
            "(H) Records for sale at another government agency. If requested materials are available for sale at another government agency, the requester will not be provided with copies of the materials but will be advised to obtain them from the selling agency. The U.S. Government Printing Office (\u201cGPO\u201d), the official bookstore for most U.S. Government publications, can be contacted at (202) 512-1800 (for those in the Washington, DC area), toll-free at (866) 512-1800 and at ContactCenter@gpo.gov. The GPO's online store can be accessed at http://bookstore.gpo.gov and mail orders should be directed to U.S. Government Printing Office, P.O. Box 979050, St. Louis, MO 63197-9000.",
            "(ii) Time limit for initial determination. (A) The deciding official (as designated by the General Counsel) will, within 20 working days of the receipt of a request, or if applicable, the date that a request is properly filed, either grant or deny, in whole or in part, such request, unless the request has been granted expedited treatment in accordance with this section, in which case the request will be processed as soon as practicable. The date that a request is properly filed is the date on which the requester agrees to pay fees necessary for a response, reasonably describes the records sought, and provides sufficient contact information for a response to be sent. Any tolling of the 20-working day period will be done in compliance with the FOIA statute, as amended.",
            "(B) Except in exceptional circumstances as provided in paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(C) of this section, the deciding official (as designated by the General Counsel) may extend the time limit by not more than 10 working days if such extension is:",
            "(1) Necessary to search for and collect the records from field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the office processing the request; or",
            "(2) Necessary to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are sought in a single or series of closely related requests; or",
            "(3) Necessary for consultation with another agency having a substantial interest in the determination, or for consultation among two or more components of the Commission having substantial subject matter interest therein.",
            "(C) If the deciding official (as designated by the General Counsel) extends the time limit for initial determination pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, the requester will be notified in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B). In exceptional circumstances, when the request cannot be processed within the extended time limit, the requester will be so notified and provided an opportunity to limit the scope of the request so that it may be processed within such time limit, or to arrange an alternative time frame for processing the request or a modified request. In exceptional circumstances, when the request cannot be processed within the extended time limit, the Commission will also make available the agency's FOIA Public Liaison to assist in the resolution of any disputes and notify the requester of the right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services. \u201cExceptional\u201d circumstances will not include delays resulting from a predictable workload of requests under this section. Unwillingness to make reasonable modifications in the scope of the request or to agree to an alternative time frame may be considered as factors in determining whether exceptional circumstances exist and whether the agency has exercised due diligence in responding to the request.",
            "(D) If the deciding official (as designated by the General Counsel) reasonably believes that requests made by a requester, or a group of requesters acting in concert, actually constitute a single request that would otherwise involve unusual circumstances, as specified in paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, and the requests involve clearly related matters, those multiple requests may be aggregated.",
            "(E) If a request is not granted within the time limits set forth in paragraphs (a)(1)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section, the request shall be deemed to be denied and the requesting party may appeal such denial to the General Counsel in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section.",
            "(iii) Initial determination. (A) The deciding official (as designated by the General Counsel) will make reasonable efforts to search, using either manual or electronic means, for documents that exist as of the date of the receipt of a request for the requested records in electronic form or format, except when such efforts would significantly interfere with the operation of the Commission's automated information systems. The deciding official will only withhold information if the agency reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by a FOIA exemption or disclosure is prohibited by law. The deciding official shall consider whether partial disclosure of information is possible whenever there is a determination that a full disclosure of a requested record is not possible and take reasonable steps necessary to segregate and release nonexempt information. Determination letters to a requester shall include the reasons therefor and the right of such person to seek assistance from the FTC's FOIA Public Liaison. Denials will advise the requester that this determination may be appealed to the General Counsel not more than 90 days after the date of the determination if the requester believes either that the records are not exempt, or that the General Counsel should exercise discretion to release such records notwithstanding their exempt status. The deciding official (as designated by the General Counsel) will also provide a reasonable, good-faith estimate of the volume of any materials to which access is denied, unless providing such an estimate would harm an interest protected by an exemption in 5 U.S.C. 552(b) that was cited as a basis for withholding materials. In the case of an adverse determination, FOIA response letters will notify requesters that they may seek dispute resolution services from the FTC's FOIA Public Liaison or from the Office of Government Information Services.",
            "(B) The deciding official (as designated by the General Counsel) is deemed to be the sole official responsible for all denials of initial requests, except denials of access to materials contained in active investigatory files, in which case the Director or Deputy Director of the Bureau or the Director of the Regional Office responsible for the investigation will be the responsible official.",
            "(C) Records to which access has been granted will be made available to the requester in any form or format specified by the requester, if the records are readily reproducible in that form or format, or can be converted to that form or format with a reasonable amount of effort. Certain records which are not easily copied or duplicated, such as tangible exhibits, will be made be available for inspection for a period not to exceed 30 days from date of notification to the requester unless the requester asks for and receives the consent of the deciding official (as designated by the General Counsel) to a longer period. Records assembled pursuant to a request will remain available only during this period and thereafter will be refiled. Appropriate fees may be imposed for any new or renewed request for the same records.",
            "(D) If a requested record cannot be located from the information supplied, or is known to have been destroyed or otherwise disposed of, the requester shall be so notified. The requester will also be notified if a record that is part of an official agency file is lost or missing. If the person so requests, he will also be notified if the record should subsequently be located.",
            "(2) FOIA Requester Service Center.

            "(2) If an initial request for records is denied in its entirety, the requester may, within 90 days after the adverse determination, appeal such denial to the General Counsel. If an initial request is denied in part, the time for appeal will not expire until 90 days after the date of the final letter notifying the requester that all records to which access has been granted have been made available.

A denial of an appeal in whole or in part will set forth the basis for the denial; will include a reasonable, good-faith estimate of the volume of any materials to which access is denied, unless providing such an estimate would harm an interest protected by an exemption in 5 U.S.C. 552(b) that was cited as a basis for withholding materials; and will advise the requester that judicial review of the decision is available by civil suit in the district in which the requester resides, or has his principal place of business, or in which the agency records are situated, or in the District of Columbia.",

This section also establishes those systems of records that are specifically exempt from disclosure and from other requirements.",
            "(2) The procedures of this section apply only to requests by an individual as defined in \u00a7 4.13(b).

If the individual elects to inspect a record in person and desires to be accompanied by another person, the deciding official (as designated by the General Counsel) may require the individual to furnish a signed statement authorizing disclosure of his or her record in the presence of the accompanying named person.",
            "(k) Fees.

In those circumstances where Commission personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the Commission has the burden of proving that compliance with \u00a7 6.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the Chairman or his or her designee after considering all Commission resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the Commission shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens, but would, nevertheless, ensure that individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.",

The Commission may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The Commission is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The Commission, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157) and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the Commission shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified individuals with handicaps in the most integrated setting appropriate.",
            "(c) Time period for compliance. The Commission shall comply with the obligations established under this section by April 1, 1988, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by February 1, 1991, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.",
            "(d) Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the Commission shall develop, by August 1, 1988, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The Commission shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with handicaps or organizations representing individuals with handicaps, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum\u2014",
            "(1) Identify physical obstacles in the Commission's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals with handicaps;",
            "(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;",
            "(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period;",
            "(4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan; and",
            "(5) Identify the persons or groups with whose assistance the plan was prepared."

As part of this special effort, advertisements, brochures and sales documents are being printed in foreign languages.

Generally, these disclosures are required to be \u201cclear and conspicuous.\u201d Because questions have arisen as to the meaning and application of the phrase \u201cclear and conspicuous\u201d with respect to foreign language advertisements and sales materials, the Commission deems it appropriate to set forth the following enforcement policy statement:",

After a thorough investigation, the Commission has determined that invisible coding has been used by the marketing research industry, but it is neither a commonly used nor widespread practice. Moreover, use of the practice appears to have diminished in recent years. For these reasons, the Commission has determined that further action is not warranted at this time.",
            "(b) However, for the purpose of providing guidance to the marketing research industry, the Commission is issuing the following statement with regard to its future enforcement intentions. The Commission has reason to believe that it is an unfair or deceptive act or practice, violative of section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45) to induce consumers to provide information about themselves by expressly or implicitly promising that such information is being provided anonymously, when, in fact, a secret or invisible code is used on the survey form or return envelope that allows identification of the consumer who has provided the information.",

            "(a) Introduction. The Commission's staff has conducted an investigation of industry trade associations and the advertising media regarding their comparative advertising policies. In the course of this investigation, numerous industry codes, statements of policy, interpretations and standards were examined. Many of the industry codes and standards contain language that could be interpreted as discouraging the use of comparative advertising. This Policy Statement enunciates the Commission's position that industry self-regulation should not restrain the use by advertisers of truthful comparative advertising.",
            "(b) Policy Statement. The Federal Trade Commission has determined that it would be of benefit to advertisers, advertising agencies, broadcasters, and self-regulation entities to restate its current policy concerning comparative advertising. \n1\n Commission policy in the area of comparative advertising encourages the naming of, or reference to competitiors, but requires clarity, and, if necessary, disclosure to avoid deception of the consumer. Additionally, the use of truthful comparative advertising should not be restrained by broadcasters or self-regulation entities.",
            "(c) The Commission has supported the use of brand comparisions where the bases of comparision are clearly identified. Comparative advertising, when truthful and nondeceptive, is a source of important information to consumers and assists them in making rational purchase decisions. Comparative advertising encourages product improvement and innovation, and can lead to lower prices in the marketplace. For these reasons, the Commission will continue to scrutinize carefully restraints upon its use.",
            "(1) Disparagement. Some industry codes which prohibit practices such as \u201cdisparagement,\u201d \u201cdisparagement of competitors,\u201d \u201cimproper disparagement,\u201d \u201cunfairly attaching,\u201d \u201cdiscrediting,\u201d may operate as a restriction on comparative advertising. The Commission has previously held that disparaging advertising is permissible so long as it is truthful and not deceptive. In Carter Products, Inc., 60 F.T.C. 782, modified, 323 F.2d 523 (5th Cir. 1963), the Commission narrowed an order recommended by the hearing examiner which would have prohibited respondents from disparaging competing products through the use of false or misleading pictures, depictions, or demonstrations, \u201cor otherwise\u201d disparaging such products. In explaining why it eliminated \u201cor otherwise\u201d from the final order, the Commission observed that the phrase would have prevented:",
            "(2) Substantiation. On occasion, a higher standard of substantiation by advertisers using comparative advertising has been required by self-regulation entities. The Commission evaluates comparative advertising in the same manner as it evaluates all other advertising techniques. The ultimate question is whether or not the advertising has a tendency or capacity to be false or deceptive. This is a factual issue to be determined on a case-by-case basis. However, industry codes and interpretations that impose a higher standard of substantiation for comparative claims than for unilateral claims are inappropriate and should be revised."

Clarification is necessary because the Truth-in-Lending Simplification and Reform Act and revised Regulation Z significantly relaxed prior Truth-in-Lending requirements on which provisions of numerous outstanding orders were based. The Policy Statement provides that the Commission will interpret and enforce Truth-in-Lending provisions of all orders so as to impose no greater or different disclosure obligations on creditors and advertisers named in such orders than are required generally of creditors and advertisers under the TILA and Regulation Z, and subsequent amendments to the TILA and Regulation Z.",

These guides also apply to all articles made from pewter. For the purposes of these guides, all articles covered by these guides are defined as \u201cindustry products.\u201d",
            "(b) These guides apply to persons, partnerships, or corporations, at every level of the trade (including but not limited to manufacturers, suppliers, and retailers) engaged in the business of offering for sale, selling, or distributing industry products.",
            "(c) These guides apply to claims and representations about industry products included in labeling, advertising, promotional materials, and all other forms of marketing, whether asserted directly or by implication, through words, symbols, emblems, logos, illustrations, depictions, product brand names, or through any other means.",
            "(d) These guides set forth the Federal Trade Commission's current thinking about claims for jewelry and articles made from precious metals and pewter. The guides help marketers and other industry members avoid making claims that are unfair or deceptive under Section 5 of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. 45. They do not confer any rights on any person and do not operate to bind the FTC or the public. The Commission, however, may take action under the FTC Act if a marketer or other industry member makes a claim inconsistent with the guides. In any such enforcement action, the Commission must prove that the challenged act or practice is unfair or deceptive in violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act.",
            "(e) The guides consist of general principles, specific guidance on the use of particular claims for industry products, and examples. Claims may raise issues that are addressed by more than one example and in more than one section of the guides. The examples provide the Commission's views on how reasonable consumers likely interpret certain claims. Industry members may use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of Section 5 of the FTC Act. Whether a particular claim is deceptive will depend on the net impression of the advertisement, label, or other promotional material at issue. In addition, although many examples present specific claims and options for qualifying claims, the examples do not illustrate all permissible claims or qualifications under Section 5 of the FTC Act."

          "paragraphs": [
            "(a) One of the most commonly used forms of bargain advertising is to offer a reduction from the advertiser's own former price for an article. If the former price is the actual, bona fide price at which the article was offered to the public on a regular basis for a reasonably substantial period of time, it provides a legitimate basis for the advertising of a price comparison. Where the former price is genuine, the bargain being advertised is a true one. If, on the other hand, the former price being advertised is not bona fide but fictitious\u2014for example, where an artificial, inflated price was established for the purpose of enabling the subsequent offer of a large reduction\u2014the \u201cbargain\u201d being advertised is a false one; the purchaser is not receiving the unusual value he expects. In such a case, the \u201creduced\u201d price is, in reality, probably just the seller's regular price.",
            "(b) A former price is not necessarily fictitious merely because no sales at the advertised price were made. The advertiser should be especially careful, however, in such a case, that the price is one at which the product was openly and actively offered for sale, for a reasonably substantial period of time, in the recent, regular course of his business, honestly and in good faith\u2014and, of course, not for the purpose of establishing a fictitious higher price on which a deceptive comparison might be based. And the advertiser should scrupulously avoid any implication that a former price is a selling, not an asking price (for example, by use of such language as, \u201cFormerly sold at $______\u201d), unless substantial sales at that price were actually made.",
            "(c) The following is an example of a price comparison based on a fictitious former price. John Doe is a retailer of Brand X fountain pens, which cost him $5 each. His usual markup is 50 percent over cost; that is, his regular retail price is $7.50. In order subsequently to offer an unusual \u201cbargain\u201d, Doe begins offering Brand X at $10 per pen. He realizes that he will be able to sell no, or very few, pens at this inflated price. But he doesn't care, for he maintains that price for only a few days. Then he \u201ccuts\u201d the price to its usual level\u2014$7.50\u2014and advertises: \u201cTerrific Bargain: X Pens, Were $10, Now Only $7.50!\u201d This is obviously a false claim. The advertised \u201cbargain\u201d is not genuine.",
            "(d) Other illustrations of fictitious price comparisons could be given. An advertiser might use a price at which he never offered the article at all; he might feature a price which was not used in the regular course of business, or which was not used in the recent past but at some remote period in the past, without making disclosure of that fact; he might use a price that was not openly offered to the public, or that was not maintained for a reasonable length of time, but was immediately reduced.",
            "(e) If the former price is set forth in the advertisement, whether accompanied or not by descriptive terminology such as \u201cRegularly,\u201d \u201cUsually,\u201d \u201cFormerly,\u201d etc., the advertiser should make certain that the former price is not a fictitious one. If the former price, or the amount or percentage of reduction, is not stated in the advertisement, as when the ad merely states, \u201cSale,\u201d the advertiser must take care that the amount of reduction is not so insignificant as to be meaningless. It should be sufficiently large that the consumer, if he knew what it was, would believe that a genuine bargain or saving was being offered. An advertiser who claims that an item has been \u201cReduced to $9.99,\u201d when the former price was $10, is misleading the consumer, who will understand the claim to mean that a much greater, and not merely nominal, reduction was being offered.

          "paragraphs": [
            "(a) Another commonly used form of bargain advertising is to offer goods at prices lower than those being charged by others for the same merchandise in the advertiser's trade area (the area in which he does business). This may be done either on a temporary or a permanent basis, but in either case the advertised higher price must be based upon fact, and not be fictitious or misleading. Whenever an advertiser represents that he is selling below the prices being charged in his area for a particular article, he should be reasonably certain that the higher price he advertises does not appreciably exceed the price at which substantial sales of the article are being made in the area\u2014that is, a sufficient number of sales so that a consumer would consider a reduction from the price to represent a genuine bargain or saving. Expressed another way, if a number of the principal retail outlets in the area are regularly selling Brand X fountain pens at $10, it is not dishonest for retailer Doe to advertise: \u201cBrand X Pens, Price Elsewhere $10, Our Price $7.50\u201d.",
            "(b) The following example, however, illustrates a misleading use of this advertising technique. Retailer Doe advertises Brand X pens as having a \u201cRetail Value $15.00, My Price $7.50,\u201d when the fact is that only a few small suburban outlets in the area charge $15. All of the larger outlets located in and around the main shopping areas charge $7.50, or slightly more or less. The advertisement here would be deceptive, since the price charged by the small suburban outlets would have no real significance to Doe's customers, to whom the advertisement of \u201cRetail Value $15.00\u201d would suggest a prevailing, and not merely an isolated and unrepresentative, price in the area in which they shop.",
            "(c) A closely related form of bargain advertising is to offer a reduction from the prices being charged either by the advertiser or by others in the advertiser's trade area for other merchandise of like grade and quality\u2014in other words, comparable or competing merchandise\u2014to that being advertised. Such advertising can serve a useful and legitimate purpose when it is made clear to the consumer that a comparison is being made with other merchandise and the other merchandise is, in fact, of essentially similar quality and obtainable in the area. The advertiser should, however, be reasonably certain, just as in the case of comparisons involving the same merchandise, that the price advertised as being the price of comparable merchandise does not exceed the price at which such merchandise is being offered by representative retail outlets in the area. For example, retailer Doe advertises Brand X pen as having \u201cComparable Value $15.00\u201d. Unless a reasonable number of the principal outlets in the area are offering Brand Y, an essentially similar pen, for that price, this advertisement would be deceptive. [Guide II]"

          "paragraphs": [
            "(a) Many members of the purchasing public believe that a manufacturer's list price, or suggested retail price, is the price at which an article is generally sold. Therefore, if a reduction from this price is advertised, many people will believe that they are being offered a genuine bargain. To the extent that list or suggested retail prices do not in fact correspond to prices at which a substantial number of sales of the article in question are made, the advertisement of a reduction may mislead the consumer.",
            "(b) There are many methods by which manufacturers' suggested retail or list prices are advertised: Large scale (often nationwide) mass-media advertising by the manufacturer himself; preticketing by the manufacturer; direct mail advertising; distribution of promotional material or price lists designed for display to the public. The mechanics used are not of the essence. This part is concerned with any means employed for placing such prices before the consuming public.",
            "(c) There would be little problem of deception in this area if all products were invariably sold at the retail price set by the manufacturer. However, the widespread failure to observe manufacturers' suggested or list prices, and the advent of retail discounting on a wide scale, have seriously undermined the dependability of list prices as indicators of the exact prices at which articles are in fact generally sold at retail. Changing competitive conditions have created a more acute problem of deception than may have existed previously. Today, only in the rare case are all sales of an article at the manufacturer's suggested retail or list price.",
            "(d) But this does not mean that all list prices are fictitious and all offers of reductions from list, therefore, deceptive. Typically, a list price is a price at which articles are sold, if not everywhere, then at least in the principal retail outlets which do not conduct their business on a discount basis. It will not be deemed fictitious if it is the price at which substantial (that is, not isolated or insignificant) sales are made in the advertiser's trade area (the area in which he does business). Conversely, if the list price is significantly in excess of the highest price at which substantial sales in the trade area are made, there is a clear and serious danger of the consumer being misled by an advertised reduction from this price.",
            "(e) This general principle applies whether the advertiser is a national or regional manufacturer (or other non-retail distributor), a mail-order or catalog distributor who deals directly with the consuming public, or a local retailer. But certain differences in the responsibility of these various types of businessmen should be noted. A retailer competing in a local area has at least a general knowledge of the prices being charged in his area. Therefore, before advertising a manufacturer's list price as a basis for comparison with his own lower price, the retailer should ascertain whether the list price is in fact the price regularly charged by principal outlets in his area.",
            "(f) In other words, a retailer who advertises a manufacturer's or distributor's suggested retail price should be careful to avoid creating a false impression that he is offering a reduction from the price at which the product is generally sold in his trade area. If a number of the principal retail outlets in the area are regularly engaged in making sales at the manufacturer's suggested price, that price may be used in advertising by one who is selling at a lower price. If, however, the list price is being followed only by, for example, small suburban stores, house-to-house canvassers, and credit houses, accounting for only an insubstantial volume of sales in the area, advertising of the list price would be deceptive.",
            "(g) On the other hand, a manufacturer or other distributor who does business on a large regional or national scale cannot be required to police or investigate in detail the prevailing prices of his articles throughout so large a trade area. If he advertises or disseminates a list or preticketed price in good faith (i.e., as an honest estimate of the actual retail price) which does not appreciably exceed the highest price at which substantial sales are made in his trade area, he will not be chargeable with having engaged in a deceptive practice. Consider the following example:",
            "(h) Manufacturer Roe, who makes Brand X pens and sells them throughout the United States, advertises his pen in a national magazine as having a \u201cSuggested Retail Price $10,\u201d a price determined on the basis of a market survey. In a substantial number of representative communities, the principal retail outlets are selling the product at this price in the regular course of business and in substantial volume. Roe would not be considered to have advertised a fictitious \u201csuggested retail price.\u201d If retailer Doe does business in one of these communities, he would not be guilty of a deceptive practice by advertising, \u201cBrand X Pens, Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price, $10, Our Price, $7.50.\u201d",
            "(i) It bears repeating that the manufacturer, distributor or retailer must in every case act honestly and in good faith in advertising a list price, and not with the intention of establishing a basis, or creating an instrumentality, for a deceptive comparison in any local or other trade area. For instance, a manufacturer may not affix price tickets containing inflated prices as an accommodation to particular retailers who intend to use such prices as the basis for advertising fictitious price reductions.

            "(a) Frequently, advertisers choose to offer bargains in the form of additional merchandise to be given a customer on the condition that he purchase a particular article at the price usually offered by the advertiser.

            "(a) Customer's liability. Sections 2(d) and (e) apply to sellers and not to customers. However, where there is likely injury to competition, the Commission may proceed under section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act against a customer who knows, or should know, that it is receiving a discriminatory price through services or allowances not made available on proportionally equal terms to its competitors engaged in the resale of a seller's product. Liability for knowingly receiving such a discrimination may result whether the discrimination takes place directly through payments or services, or indirectly through deductions from purchase invoices or other similar means. In addition, the giving or knowing inducement or receipt of proportionally unequal promotional allowances may be challenged under sections 2(a) and 2(f) of the Act, respectively, where no promotional services are performed in return for the payments, or where the payments are not reasonably related to the customer's cost of providing the promotional services. See, e.g., American Booksellers Ass'n v. Barnes & Noble, 135 F. Supp. 2d 1031 (N.D. Cal. 2001); but see United Magazine Co. v. Murdoch Magazines Distrib., Inc. 2001 U.S. Dist.

            "(b) Third party liability. Third parties, such as advertising media, may violate section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act through double or fictitious rates or billing. An advertising medium, such as the Internet, a newspaper, broadcast station, or printer of catalogues, that publishes a rate schedule containing fictitious rates (or rates that are not reasonably expected to be applicable to a representative number of advertisers), may violate section 5 if the customer uses such deceptive schedule or invoice for a claim for an advertising allowance, payment or credit greater than that to which it would be entitled under the seller's promotional offering. Similarly, an advertising medium that furnishes a customer with an invoice that does not reflect the customer's actual net advertising cost may violate section 5 if the customer uses the invoice to obtain larger payments than it is entitled to receive."

This defense is available with respect to payments or services offered on an area-wide basis, to those offered to new as well as old customers, and regardless of whether the discrimination has been caused by a decrease or an increase in the payments or services offered.

            "(a) General. (1) The offer of \u201cFree\u201d merchandise or service is a promotional device frequently used to attract customers. Providing such merchandise or service with the purchase of some other article or service has often been found to be a useful and valuable marketing tool.",
            "(2) Because the purchasing public continually searches for the best buy, and regards the offer of \u201cFree\u201d merchandise or service to be a special bargain, all such offers must be made with extreme care so as to avoid any possibility that consumers will be misled or deceived. Representative of the language frequently used in such offers are \u201cFree\u201d, \u201cBuy 1-Get 1 Free\u201d, \u201c2-for-1 Sale\u201d, \u201c50% off with purchase of Two\u201d, \u201c1\u00a2 Sale\u201d, etc. (Related representations that raise many of the same questions include \u201c____ Cents-Off\u201d, \u201cHalf-Price Sale\u201d, \u201c\n1/2 Off\u201d, etc. See the Commission's \u201cFair Packaging and Labeling Regulation Regarding \u2018Cents-Off\u2019 and Guides Against Deceptive Pricing.\u201d)",
            "(b) Meaning of \u201cFree\u201d. (1) The public understands that, except in the case of introductory offers in connection with the sale of a product or service (See paragraph (f) of this section), an offer of \u201cFree\u201d merchandise or service is based upon a regular price for the merchandise or service which must be purchased by consumers in order to avail themselves of that which is represented to be \u201cFree\u201d. In other words, when the purchaser is told that an article is \u201cFree\u201d to him if another article is purchased, the word \u201cFree\u201d indicates that he is paying nothing for that article and no more than the regular price for the other. Thus, a purchaser has a right to believe that the merchant will not directly and immediately recover, in whole or in part, the cost of the free merchandise or service by marking up the price of the article which must be purchased, by the substitution of inferior merchandise or service, or otherwise.",
            "(2) The term regular when used with the term price, means the price, in the same quantity, quality and with the same service, at which the seller or advertiser of the product or service has openly and actively sold the product or service in the geographic market or trade area in which he is making a \u201cFree\u201d or similar offer in the most recent and regular course of business, for a reasonably substantial period of time, i.e., a 30-day period. For consumer products or services which fluctuate in price, the \u201cregular\u201d price shall be the lowest price at which any substantial sales were made during the aforesaid 30-day period. Except in the case of introductory offers, if no substantial sales were made, in fact, at the \u201cregular\u201d price, a \u201cFree\u201d or similar offer would not be proper.",
            "(c) Disclosure of conditions. When making \u201cFree\u201d or similar offers all the terms, conditions and obligations upon which receipt and retention of the \u201cFree\u201d item are contingent should be set forth clearly and conspicuously at the outset of the offer so as to leave no reasonable probability that the terms of the offer might be misunderstood. Stated differently, all of the terms, conditions and obligations should appear in close conjunction with the offer of \u201cFree\u201d merchandise or service. For example, disclosure of the terms of the offer set forth in a footnote of an advertisement to which reference is made by an asterisk or other symbol placed next to the offer, is not regarded as making disclosure at the outset. However, mere notice of the existence of a \u201cFree\u201d offer on the main display panel of a label or package is not precluded provided that (1) the notice does not constitute an offer or identify the item being offered \u201cFree\u201d, (2) the notice informs the customer of the location, elsewhere on the package or label, where the disclosures required by this section may be found, (3) no purchase or other such material affirmative act is required in order to discover the terms and conditions of the offer, and (4) the notice and the offer are not otherwise deceptive.",
            "(d) Supplier's responsibilities. Nothing in this section should be construed as authorizing or condoning the illegal setting or policing of retail prices by a supplier. However, if the supplier knows, or should know, that a \u201cFree\u201d offer he is promoting is not being passed on by a reseller, or otherwise is being used by a reseller as an instrumentality for deception, it is improper for the supplier to continue to offer the product as promoted to such reseller. He should take appropriate steps to bring an end to the deception, inlcuding the withdrawal of the \u201cFree\u201d offer.",
            "(e) Resellers' participation in supplier's offers. Prior to advertising a \u201cFree\u201d promotion, a supplier should offer the product as promoted to all competing resellers as provided for in the Commission's \u201cGuides for Advertising Allowances and Other Merchandising Payments and Services.\u201d In advertising the \u201cFree\u201d promotion, the supplier should identify those areas in which the offer is not available if the advertising is likely to be seen in such areas, and should clearly state that it is available only through participating resellers, indicating the extent of participation by the use of such terms as \u201csome\u201d, \u201call\u201d, \u201ca majority\u201d, or \u201ca few\u201d, as the case may be.",
            "(f) Introductory offers. (1) No \u201cFree\u201d offer should be made in connection with the introduction of a new product or service offered for sale at a specified price unless the offeror expects, in good faith, to discontinue the offer after a limited time and to commence selling the product or service promoted, separately, at the same price at which it was promoted with the \u201cFree\u201d offer.",
            "(2) In such offers, no representation may be made that the price is for one item and that the other is \u201cFree\u201d unless the offeror expects, in good faith, to discontinue the offer after a limited time and to commence selling the product or service promoted, separately, at the same price at which it was promoted with a \u201cFree\u201d offer.",
            "(g) Negotiated sales. If a product or service usually is sold at a price arrived at through bargaining, rather than at a regular price, it is improper to represent that another product or service is being offered \u201cFree\u201d with the sale. The same representation is also improper where there may be a regular price, but where other material factors such as quantity, quality, or size are arrived at through bargaining.",
            "(h) Frequency of offers. So that a \u201cFree\u201d offer will be special and meaningful, a single size of a product or a single kind of service should not be advertised with a \u201cFree\u201d offer in a trade area for more than 6 months in any 12-month period. At least 30 days should elapse before another such offer is promoted in the same trade area. No more than three such offers should be made in the same area in any 12-month period. In such period, the offeror's sale in that area of the product in the size promoted with a \u201cFree\u201d offer should not exceed 50 percent of the total volume of his sales of the product, in the same size, in the area.",
            "(i) Similar terms. Offers of \u201cFree\u201d merchandise or services which may be deceptive for failure to meet the provisions of this section may not be corrected by the substitution of such similar words and terms as \u201cgift\u201d, \u201cgiven without charge\u201d, \u201cbonus\u201d, or other words or terms which tend to convey the impression to the consuming public that an article of merchandise or service is \u201cFree\u201d."

            "(a) The Guides in this part represent administrative interpretations of laws enforced by the Federal Trade Commission for the guidance of the public in conducting its affairs in conformity with legal requirements. Specifically, the Guides address the application of section 5 of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. 45, to the use of endorsements and testimonials in advertising. The Guides provide the basis for voluntary compliance with the law by advertisers and endorsers. Practices inconsistent with these Guides may result in corrective action by the Commission under section 5 if, after investigation, the Commission has reason to believe that the practices fall within the scope of conduct declared unlawful by the statute. The Guides set forth the general principles that the Commission will use in evaluating endorsements and testimonials, together with examples illustrating the application of those principles. The examples in each section apply the principles of that section to particular factual scenarios but do not address every possible issue that the facts or principles might implicate. Nor do the Guides purport to cover every possible use of endorsements in advertising.\n1\n Whether a particular endorsement or testimonial is deceptive will depend on the specific factual circumstances of the advertisement at issue.",
            "(b) For purposes of this part, an \u201cendorsement\u201d means any advertising, marketing, or promotional message for a product that consumers are likely to believe reflects the opinions, beliefs, findings, or experiences of a party other than the sponsoring advertiser, even if the views expressed by that party are identical to those of the sponsoring advertiser. Verbal statements, tags in social media posts, demonstrations, depictions of the name, signature, likeness or other identifying personal characteristics of an individual, and the name or seal of an organization can be endorsements. The party whose opinions, beliefs, findings, or experience the message appears to reflect will be called the \u201cendorser\u201d and could be or appear to be an individual, group, or institution.",
            "(c) The Commission intends to treat endorsements and testimonials identically in the context of its enforcement of the Federal Trade Commission Act and for purposes of this part. The term endorsements is therefore generally used hereinafter to cover both terms and situations.",
            "(d) For purposes of this part, the term \u201cproduct\u201d includes any product, service, brand, company, or industry.",
            "(e) For purposes of this part, an \u201cexpert\u201d is an individual, group, or institution possessing, as a result of experience, study, or training, knowledge of a particular subject, which knowledge is superior to what ordinary individuals generally acquire.",
            "(f) For purposes of this part, \u201cclear and conspicuous\u201d means that a disclosure is difficult to miss (i.e., easily noticeable) and easily understandable by ordinary consumers. If a communication's representation necessitating a disclosure is made through visual means, the disclosure should be made in at least the communication's visual portion; if the representation is made through audible means, the disclosure should be made in at least the communication's audible portion; and if the representation is made through both visual and audible means, the disclosure should be made in the communication's visual and audible portions. A disclosure presented simultaneously in both the visual and audible portions of a communication is more likely to be clear and conspicuous. A visual disclosure, by its size, contrast, location, the length of time it appears, and other characteristics, should stand out from any accompanying text or other visual elements so that it is easily noticed, read, and understood. An audible disclosure should be delivered in a volume, speed, and cadence sufficient for ordinary consumers to easily hear and understand it. In any communication using an interactive electronic medium, such as social media or the internet, the disclosure should be unavoidable. The disclosure should not be contradicted or mitigated by, or inconsistent with, anything else in the communication. When an endorsement targets a specific audience, such as older adults, \u201cordinary consumers\u201d includes members of that group.",
            "(g) Examples:",
            "(1) Example 1. A film critic's review of a movie is excerpted in an advertisement placed by the film's producer. The critic's review is not an endorsement, but when the excerpt from the review is used in the producer's advertisement, the excerpt becomes an endorsement. Readers would view it as a statement of the critic's own opinions and not those of the producer. If the excerpt alters or quotes from the text of the review in a way that does not fairly reflect its substance, the advertisement would be deceptive because it distorts the endorser's opinion. (See \u00a7 255.1(b))",
            "(2) Example 2. A television commercial depicts two unidentified shoppers in a supermarket buying a laundry detergent. One comments to the other how clean the advertised brand makes the shopper's clothes. The other shopper then replies, \u201cI will try it because I have not been fully satisfied with my own brand.\u201d This obviously fictional dramatization would not be an endorsement.",
            "(3) Example 3. In an advertisement for a pain remedy, an announcer unfamiliar to consumers except as a spokesperson for the advertising drug company praises the drug's ability to deliver fast and lasting pain relief. The spokesperson does not purport to speak from personal experience, nor on the basis of their own opinions, but rather in the place of and on behalf of the drug company. The announcer's statements would not be considered an endorsement.",
            "(4) Example 4. A manufacturer of automobile tires hires a well-known professional automobile racing driver to deliver its advertising message in television commercials. In these commercials, the driver speaks of the smooth ride, strength, and long life of the tires. Many consumers are likely to believe this message reflects the driver's personal views, even if the driver does not say so, because consumers recognize the speaker primarily as a racing driver and not merely as a product spokesperson. Accordingly, many consumers would likely believe the driver would not speak for an automotive product without actually believing in the product and having personal knowledge sufficient to form the beliefs expressed. The likely attribution of these beliefs to the driver makes this message an endorsement under the Guides.",
            "(5) Example 5. (i) A television advertisement for a brand of golf balls includes a video of a prominent and well-recognized professional golfer practicing numerous drives off the tee. The video would be an endorsement even though the golfer makes no verbal statement in the advertisement.",
            "(ii) The golfer is also hired to post the video to their social media account. The paid post is an endorsement if viewers can readily identify the golf ball brand, either because it is apparent from the video or because it is tagged or otherwise mentioned in the post.",
            "(6) Example 6. (i) An infomercial for a home fitness system is hosted by a well-known actor. During the infomercial, the actor demonstrates the machine and states, \u201cThis is the most effective and easy-to-use home exercise machine that I have ever tried.\u201d Even if the actor is reading from a script, the statement would be an endorsement, because consumers are likely to believe it reflects the actor's personal views.",
            "(ii) Assume that, rather than speaking about their experience with or opinion of the machine, the actor says that the machine was designed by exercise physiologists at a leading university, that it isolates each of five major muscle groups, and that it is meant to be used for fifteen minutes a day. After demonstrating various exercises using the machine, the actor finally says how much the machine costs and how to order it. As the actor does not say or do anything during the infomercial that would lead viewers to believe that the actor is expressing their own views about the machine, there is no endorsement.",
            "(7) Example 7. (i) A consumer who regularly purchases a particular brand of dog food decides one day to purchase a new, more expensive brand made by the same manufacturer with their own money. The purchaser posts to their social media account that the change in diet has made their dog's fur noticeably softer and shinier, and that in their opinion, the new dog food definitely is worth the extra money. Because the consumer has no connection to the manufacturer beyond being an ordinary purchaser, their message cannot be attributed to the manufacturer and the post would not be deemed an endorsement under the Guides. The same would be true if the purchaser writes a consumer product review on an independent review website. But, if the consumer submits the review to the review section of the manufacturer's website and the manufacturer chooses to highlight the review on the homepage of its website, then the review as featured is an endorsement even though there is no connection between the consumer and the manufacturer.",
            "(ii) Assume that rather than purchase the dog food with their own money, the consumer receives it for free because the store routinely tracks purchases and the dog food manufacturer arranged for the store to provide a coupon for a free trial bag of its new brand to all purchasers of its existing brand. The manufacturer does not ask coupon recipients for product reviews and recipients likely would not assume that the manufacturer expects them to post reviews. The consumer's post would not be deemed an endorsement under the Guides because this unsolicited review cannot be attributed to the manufacturer.",
            "(iii) Assume now that the consumer joins a marketing program under which participants agree to periodically receive free products from various manufacturers and write reviews of them. If the consumer receives a free bag of the new dog food through this program, their positive review would be considered an endorsement under the Guides because of their connection to the manufacturer through the marketing program.",
            "(iv) Assume that the consumer is the owner of a \u201cdog influencer\u201d (a dog with a social media account and a large number of followers). If the manufacturer sends the consumer coupons for a year's worth of dog food and asks the consumer to feature the brand in their dog's social media feed, any resulting posts that feature the brand would be considered endorsements even though the owner could have chosen not to endorse the product.",
            "(8) Example 8. A college student, who has earned a reputation as an excellent video game player, live streams their game play. The developer of a new video game pays the student to play and live stream its new game. The student plays the game and appears to enjoy it. Even though the college student does not expressly recommend the game, the game play is considered an endorsement because the apparent enjoyment is implicitly a recommendation.",
            "(9) Example 9. (i) An influencer who is paid to endorse a vitamin product in their social media posts discloses their connection to the product's manufacturer only on the profile pages of their social media accounts. The disclosure is not clear and conspicuous because people seeing their paid posts could easily miss the disclosure.",
            "(ii) Assume now that the influencer discloses their connection to the manufacturer but that, in order to see the disclosures, consumers have to click on a link in the posts labeled simply \u201cmore.\u201d If the endorsement is visible without having to click on the link labeled \u201cmore,\u201d but the disclosure is not visible without doing so, then the disclosure is not unavoidable and thus is not clear and conspicuous.",
            "(iii) Assume now that the influencer relies solely upon a social media platform's built-in disclosure tool for one of these posts. The disclosure appears in small white text, it is set against the light background of the image that the influencer posted, it competes with unrelated text that the influencer superimposed on the image, and the post appears for only five seconds. The disclosure is easy to miss and thus not clear and conspicuous.",
            "(10) Example 10. A television advertisement promotes a smartphone app that purportedly halts cognitive decline. The ad presents multiple endorsements by older senior citizens who are represented as actual consumers who used the app. The advertisement discloses via both audio and visual means that the persons featured are actors. Because the advertisement is targeted at older consumers, whether the disclosure is clear and conspicuous will be evaluated from the perspective of older consumers, including those with diminished auditory, visual, or cognitive processing abilities.",
            "(11) Example 11. (i) A social media advertisement promoting a cholesterol-lowering product features a testimonialist who says by how much their serum cholesterol went down. The claimed reduction greatly exceeds what is typically experienced by users of the product and a disclosure of typical results is required. The marketer has been able to identify from online data collection individuals with high cholesterol levels who speak a particular foreign language and are unable to understand English. It microtargets a foreign-language version of the ad to them, disclosing users' typical results only in English. The adequacy of the disclosure will be evaluated from the perspective of the microtargeted individuals, and the disclosure must be in the same language as the ad.",
            "(ii) Assume now that the ad has a disclosure that is clear and conspicuous when viewed on a computer browser but that it is not clear and conspicuous when the ad is rendered on a smartphone. Because some consumers will view the ad on their smartphones, the disclosure is inadequate.",
            "(12) Example 12. An exterminator purchases fake negative reviews of competing exterminators. A paid or otherwise incentivized negative statement about a competitor's service is not an endorsement, as that term is used in the Guides. Nevertheless, such statements, e.g., a paid negative review of a competing product, can be deceptive in violation of section 5. (See \u00a7 255.2.(e)(4)(v) regarding the purchase of a fake positive review for a product.) Fake positive reviews that are used to promote a product are \u201cendorsements.\u201d",
            "(13) Example 13. A motivational speaker buys fake social media followers to impress potential clients. The use by endorsers of fake indicators of social media influence, such as fake social media followers, is not itself an endorsement issue. The Commission notes, however, that it is a deceptive practice for users of social media platforms to purchase or create indicators of social media influence and then use them to misrepresent such influence to potential clients, purchasers, investors, partners, or employees or to anyone else for a commercial purpose. It is also a deceptive practice to sell or distribute such indicators to such users."

          "paragraphs": [
            "(a) Endorsements must reflect the honest opinions, findings, beliefs, or experience of the endorser. Furthermore, an endorsement may not convey any express or implied representation that would be deceptive if made directly by the advertiser. (See \u00a7 255.2(a) and (b) regarding substantiation of representations conveyed by consumer endorsements.)",
            "(b) An advertisement need not present an endorser's message in the exact words of the endorser unless the advertisement represents that it is presenting the endorser's exact words, such as through the use of quotation marks. However, the endorsement may not be presented out of context or reworded so as to distort in any way the endorser's opinion or experience with the product. An advertiser may use an endorsement of an expert or celebrity only so long as it has good reason to believe that the endorser continues to subscribe to the views presented. An advertiser may satisfy this obligation by securing the endorser's views at reasonable intervals where reasonableness will be determined by such factors as new information about the performance or effectiveness of the product, a material alteration in the product, changes in the performance of competitors' products, and the advertiser's contract commitments.",
            "(c) When the advertisement represents that the endorser uses the endorsed product, the endorser must have been a bona fide user of it at the time the endorsement was given. Additionally, the advertiser may continue to run the advertisement only so long as it has good reason to believe that the endorser remains a bona fide user of the product. (See paragraph (b) of this section regarding the \u201cgood reason to believe\u201d requirement.)",
            "(d) Advertisers are subject to liability for misleading or unsubstantiated statements made through endorsements or for failing to disclose unexpected material connections between themselves and their endorsers. (See \u00a7 255.5.) An advertiser may be liable for a deceptive endorsement even when the endorser is not liable. Advertisers should:",
            "(1) Provide guidance to their endorsers on the need to ensure that their statements are not misleading and to disclose unexpected material connections;",
            "(2) Monitor their endorsers' compliance; and",
            "(3) Take action sufficient to remedy non-compliance and prevent future non-compliance. While not a safe harbor, good faith and effective guidance, monitoring, and remedial action should reduce the incidence of deceptive claims and reduce an advertiser's odds of facing a Commission enforcement action.",
            "(e) Endorsers may be liable for statements made in the course of their endorsements, such as when an endorser makes a representation that the endorser knows or should know to be deceptive, including when an endorser falsely represents that they personally used a product. Also, an endorser who is not an expert may be liable for misleading or unsubstantiated representations regarding a product's performance or effectiveness, such as when the representations are inconsistent with the endorser's personal experience or were not made or approved by the advertiser and go beyond the scope of the endorser's personal experience. (For the responsibilities of an endorser who is an expert, see \u00a7 255.3.) Endorsers may also be liable for failing to disclose unexpected material connections between themselves and an advertiser, such as when an endorser creates and disseminates endorsements without such disclosures.",
            "(f) Advertising agencies, public relations firms, review brokers, reputation management companies, and other similar intermediaries may be liable for their roles in creating or disseminating endorsements containing representations that they know or should know are deceptive. They may also be liable for their roles with respect to endorsements that fail to disclose unexpected material connections, whether by disseminating advertisements without necessary disclosures or by hiring and directing endorsers who fail to make necessary disclosures.",
            "(g) The use of an endorsement with the image or likeness of a person other than the actual endorser is deceptive if it misrepresents a material attribute of the endorser.",
            "(h) Examples:",
            "(1) Example 1. (i) A building contractor states in an advertisement disseminated by a paint manufacturer, \u201cI use XYZ exterior house paint because of its remarkable quick drying properties and durability.\u201d This endorsement must comply with the pertinent requirements of \u00a7 255.3. Subsequently, the advertiser reformulates its paint to enable it to cover exterior surfaces with only one coat. Prior to continued use of the contractor's endorsement, the advertiser must contact the contractor in order to determine whether the contractor would continue to use the paint as reformulated and to subscribe to the views presented previously.",
            "(ii) Assume that, before the reformulation, the contractor had posted an endorsement of the paint to their social media account. Even if the contractor would not use or recommend the reformulated paint, there is no obligation for the contractor or the manufacturer to modify or delete a historic post containing the endorsement as long as the date of that post is clear and conspicuous to viewers. If the contractor reposts or the advertiser shares the contractor's original endorsement after the reformulation, consumers would expect that the contractor holds the views expressed in the original post with respect to the reformulated product and the advertiser would need to confirm that with the contractor.",
            "(2) Example 2. In a radio advertisement played during commercial breaks, a well-known DJ talks about how much they enjoy making coffee with a particular coffee maker in the morning. The DJ's comments likely communicate that they regularly use the coffee maker. If, instead, they used it only during a demonstration by its manufacturer, the ad would be deceptive.",
            "(3) Example 3. (i) A dermatologist is a paid advisor to a pharmaceutical company and is asked by the company to post about its products on their professional social media account. The dermatologist posts that the company's newest acne treatment product is \u201cclinically proven\u201d to work. Before giving the endorsement, the dermatologist received a write-up of the clinical study in question, which indicates flaws in the design and conduct of the study that are so serious that they preclude any conclusions about the efficacy of the product. Given their medical expertise, the dermatologist should have recognized the study's flaws and is subject to liability for their false statements made in the advertisement. The advertiser is also liable for the misrepresentation made through the endorsement. (See \u00a7 255.3 regarding the product evaluation that an expert endorser must conduct.) Even if the study was sufficient to establish the product's proven efficacy, the pharmaceutical company and the dermatologist are both potentially liable if the endorser fails to disclose their relationship to the company. (See \u00a7 255.5 regarding the disclosure of unexpected material connections.)",
            "(ii) Assume that the expert had asked the pharmaceutical company for the evidence supporting its claims and there were no apparent design or execution flaws in the study shown to the expert, but that the pharmaceutical company had withheld a larger and better controlled, non-published proprietary study of the acne treatment that failed to find any statistically significant improvement in acne. The expert's \u201cclinically proven\u201d to work claim would be deceptive and the company would be liable for the claim, but because the dermatologist did not have a reason to know that the claim was deceptive, the expert would not be liable.",
            "(4) Example 4. A well-known celebrity appears in an infomercial for a hot air roaster that purportedly cooks a chicken perfectly in twenty minutes. During the shooting of the infomercial, the celebrity watches five attempts to cook chickens using the roaster. In each attempt, the chicken is undercooked after twenty minutes and requires forty-five minutes of cooking time. In the commercial, the celebrity places an uncooked chicken in the roaster. The celebrity then takes from a second roaster what appears to be a perfectly cooked chicken, tastes the chicken, and says that if you want perfect chicken every time, in just twenty minutes, this is the product you need. A significant percentage of consumers are likely to believe the statement represents the celebrity's own view and experience even though the celebrity is reading from a script. Because the celebrity knows that their statement is untrue, the endorser is subject to liability. The advertiser is also liable for misrepresentations made through the endorsement.",
            "(5) Example 5. A skin care products advertiser hires an influencer to promote its products on the influencer's social media account. The advertiser requests that the influencer try a new body lotion and post a video review of it. The advertiser does not provide the influencer with any materials stating that the lotion cures skin conditions and the influencer does not ask the advertiser if it does. However, believing that the lotion cleared up their eczema, the influencer says in their review, \u201cThis lotion cures eczema. All of my followers suffering from eczema should use it.\u201d The influencer, who did not limit their statements to their personal experience using the product and did not have a reasonable basis for their claim that the lotion cures eczema, is subject to liability for the misleading or unsubstantiated representation in the endorsement. If the advertiser lacked adequate substantiation for the implied claims that the lotion cures eczema, it would be liable regardless of the liability of the endorser. The influencer and the advertiser may also be liable if the influencer fails to disclose clearly and conspicuously being paid for the endorsement. (See \u00a7 255.5.) In order to limit its potential liability, the advertiser should provide guidance to its influencers concerning the need to ensure that statements they make are truthful and substantiated and the need to disclose unexpected material connections and take other steps to discourage or prevent non-compliance. The advertiser should also monitor its influencers' compliance and take steps necessary to remove and halt the continued publication of deceptive representations when they are discovered and to ensure the disclosure of unexpected material connections. (See paragraph (d) of this section and \u00a7 255.5.)",
            "(6) Example 6. (i) The website for an acne treatment features accurate testimonials of users who say that the product improved their acne quickly and with no side effects. Instead of using images of the actual endorsers, the website accompanies the testimonials with stock photos the advertiser purchased of individuals with near perfect skin. The images misrepresent the improvements to the endorsers' complexions.",
            "(ii) The same website also sells QRS Weight-Loss shakes and features a truthful testimonial from an individual who says, \u201cI lost 50 pounds by just drinking the shakes.\u201d Instead of accompanying the testimonial with a picture of the actual endorser, who went from 300 pounds to 250 pounds, the website shows a picture of an individual who appears to weigh about 100 pounds. By suggesting that QRS Weight-Loss shakes caused the endorser to lose one-third of their original body weight (going from 150 pounds to 100 pounds), the image misrepresents the product's effectiveness. Even if it is accompanied by a picture of the actual endorser, the testimonial could still communicate a deceptive typicality claim.",
            "(7) Example 7. A learn-to-read program disseminates a sponsored social media post by a parent saying that the program helped their child learn to read. The picture accompanying the post is not of the endorser and their child. The testimonial is from the parent of a 7-year-old, but the post shows an image of a child who appears to be only 4 years old. By suggesting that the program taught a 4-year-old to read, the image misrepresents the effectiveness of the program."

          "heading": "\u00a7 255.2   Consumer endorsements.",
          "paragraphs": [
            "(a) An advertisement employing endorsements by one or more consumers about the performance of an advertised product will be interpreted as representing that the product is effective for the purpose depicted in the advertisement. Therefore, the advertiser must possess and rely upon adequate substantiation, including, when appropriate, competent and reliable scientific evidence, to support express and implied claims made through endorsements in the same manner the advertiser would be required to do if it had made the representation directly, i.e., without using endorsements. Consumer endorsements themselves are not competent and reliable scientific evidence.",
            "(b) An advertisement containing an endorsement relating the experience of one or more consumers on a central or key attribute of the product will likely be interpreted as representing that the endorser's experience is representative of what consumers will generally achieve with the advertised product in actual, albeit variable, conditions of use. Therefore, an advertiser should possess and rely upon adequate substantiation for this representation. If the advertiser does not have substantiation that the endorser's experience is representative of what consumers will generally achieve, the advertisement should clearly and conspicuously disclose the generally expected performance in the depicted circumstances, and the advertiser must possess and rely on adequate substantiation for that representation. The disclosure of the generally expected performance should be presented in a manner that does not itself misrepresent what consumers can expect. To be effective, such disclosure must alter the net impression of the advertisement so that it is not misleading.",
            "(c) Advertisements presenting endorsements by what are represented, expressly or by implication, to be \u201cactual consumers\u201d should utilize actual consumers in both the audio and video, or clearly and conspicuously disclose that the persons in such advertisements are not actual consumers of the advertised product.",
            "(d) In procuring, suppressing, boosting, organizing, publishing, upvoting, downvoting, reporting, or editing consumer reviews of their products, advertisers should not take actions that have the effect of distorting or otherwise misrepresenting what consumers think of their products, regardless of whether the reviews are considered endorsements under the Guides.",
            "(e) Examples:",
            "(1) Example 1. (i) A web page for a baldness treatment consists entirely of testimonials from satisfied customers who say that after using the product, they had amazing hair growth and their hair is as thick and strong as it was when they were teenagers. The advertiser must have competent and reliable scientific evidence that its product is effective in producing new hair growth.",
            "(ii) The web page will also likely communicate that the endorsers' experiences are representative of what new users of the product can generally expect. Therefore, even if the advertiser includes a disclaimer such as, \u201cNotice: These testimonials do not prove our product works. You should not expect to have similar results,\u201d the ad is likely to be deceptive unless the advertiser has adequate substantiation that new users typically will experience results similar to those experienced by the testimonialists.",
            "(2) Example 2. (i) An advertisement disseminated by a company that sells heat pumps presents endorsements from three individuals who state that after installing the company's heat pump in their homes, their monthly utility bills went down by $100, $125, and $150, respectively. The ad will likely be interpreted as conveying that such savings are representative of what consumers who buy the heat pump can generally expect. The advertiser does not have substantiation for that representation because, in fact, fewer than 20% of purchasers will save $100 or more. A disclosure such as, \u201cResults not typical\u201d or \u201cThese testimonials are based on the experiences of a few people and you are not likely to have similar results\u201d is insufficient to prevent this ad from being deceptive because consumers will still interpret the ad as conveying that the specified savings are representative of what consumers can generally expect.",
            "(A) In another context, the Commission tested the communication of advertisements containing testimonials that clearly and prominently disclosed either \u201cResults not typical\u201d or the stronger \u201cThese testimonials are based on the experiences of a few people and you are not likely to have similar results.\u201d Neither disclosure adequately reduced the communication that the experiences depicted are generally representative. Based upon this research, the Commission believes that similar disclaimers regarding the limited applicability of an endorser's experience to what consumers may generally expect to achieve are unlikely to be effective. Although the Commission would have the burden of proof in a law enforcement action, the Commission notes that an advertiser possessing reliable empirical testing demonstrating that the net impression of its advertisement with such a disclaimer is non-deceptive will avoid the risk of the initiation of such an action in the first instance.",
            "(B) The advertiser should clearly and conspicuously disclose the generally expected savings and have adequate substantiation that homeowners can achieve those results. There are multiple ways that such a disclosure could be phrased, e.g., \u201cthe average homeowner saves $35 per month,\u201d \u201cthe typical family saves $50 per month during cold months and $20 per month in warm months,\u201d or \u201cmost families save 10% on their utility bills.\u201d",
            "(ii) Disclosures like those in this Example 2, specifically paragraph (e)(2)(i)(B) of this section, could still be misleading, however, if they only apply to limited circumstances that are not described in the advertisement. For example, if the advertisement does not limit its claims by geography, it would be misleading if the disclosure of expected results in a nationally disseminated advertisement was based on the experiences of customers in a southern climate and the experiences of those customers was much better than could be expected by heat pump users in a northern climate.",
            "(3) Example 3. An advertisement for a cholesterol-lowering product features individuals who claim that their serum cholesterol went down by 120 points and 130 points, respectively; the ad does not mention the endorsers having made any lifestyle changes. A well-conducted clinical study shows that the product reduces the cholesterol levels of individuals with elevated cholesterol by an average of 15% and the advertisement clearly and conspicuously discloses this fact. Despite the presence of this disclosure, the advertisement would be deceptive if the advertiser does not have competent and reliable scientific evidence that the product can produce the specific results claimed by the endorsers (i.e., a 130-point drop in serum cholesterol without any lifestyle changes).",
            "(4) Example 4. (i) An advertisement for a weight-loss product features an endorsement by a formerly obese person who says, \u201cEvery day, I drank 2 QRS Weight-Loss shakes, ate only raw vegetables, and exercised vigorously for six hours at the gym. By the end of six months, I had gone from 250 pounds to 140 pounds.\u201d The advertisement accurately describes the endorser's experience, and such a result is within the range that would be generally experienced by an extremely overweight individual who consumed QRS Weight-Loss shakes, only ate raw vegetables, and exercised as the endorser did. Because the endorser clearly describes the limited and truly exceptional circumstances under which they achieved the claimed results, the ad is not likely to convey that consumers who weigh substantially less or use QRS Weight-Loss under less extreme circumstances will lose 110 pounds in six months. If the advertisement simply says that the endorser lost 110 pounds in six months using QRS Weight-Loss together with diet and exercise, however, this description would not adequately alert consumers to the truly remarkable circumstances leading to the endorser's weight loss. The advertiser must have substantiation, however, for any performance claims conveyed by the endorsement (e.g., that QRS Weight-Loss is an effective weight-loss product and that the endorser's weight loss was not caused solely by their dietary restrictions and exercise regimen).",
            "(ii) If, in the alternative, the advertisement simply features \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d pictures of a woman who says, \u201cI lost 50 pounds in 6 months with QRS Weight-Loss,\u201d the ad is likely to convey that the endorser's experience is representative of what consumers will generally achieve. Therefore, if consumers cannot generally expect to achieve such results, the ad would be deceptive. Instead, the ad should clearly and conspicuously disclose what they can expect to lose in the depicted circumstances (e.g., \u201cwomen who use QRS Weight-Loss for six months typically lose 15 pounds\u201d). A disclosure such as \u201cAverage weight loss is 1-2 pounds per week\u201d is inadequate because it does not effectively communicate the expected weight loss over six months. Furthermore, that disclosure likely implies that weight loss continues at that rate over six months, which would not be true if, for example, the average weekly weight loss over six months is .57 pounds.",
            "(iii) If the ad features the same pictures but the testimonialist simply says, \u201cI lost 50 pounds with QRS Weight-Loss,\u201d and QRS Weight-Loss users generally do not lose 50 pounds, the ad should disclose what results they do generally achieve (e.g., \u201cwomen who use QRS Weight-Loss lose 15 pounds on average\u201d). A disclosure such as \u201cmost women who use QRS Weight-Loss lose between 10 and 50 pounds\u201d is inadequate because the range specified is so broad that it does not sufficiently communicate what users can generally expect.",
            "(iv) Assume that a QRS Weight-Loss advertisement contains a disclosure of generally expected results that is based upon the mean weight loss of users. If the mean is substantially affected by outliers, then the disclosure would be misleading. For example, if the mean weight loss is 15 pounds, but the median weight loss is 8 pounds, it would be misleading to say that the average weight loss was 15 pounds. In such cases, the disclosure's use of median weight loss instead could help avoid deception, e.g., \u201cmost users lose 8 pounds\u201d or \u201cthe typical user loses 8 pounds.\u201d",
            "(v) Assume that QRS Weight-Loss's manufacturer procured a fake consumer review, reading \u201cI lost 50 pounds with QRS Weight-Loss,\u201d and had it published on a third-party review website. This endorsement is deceptive because it was not written by a bona fide user of the product (see \u00a7 255.1(c)) and because it does not reflect the honest opinions, findings, beliefs, or experience of the endorser (see \u00a7 255.1(a)). Moreover, the manufacturer would need competent and reliable scientific evidence that QRS Weight-Loss is capable of causing 50-pound weight loss.",
            "(vi) Assume that QRS Weight-Loss is a diet and exercise program and a person appearing in a QRS Weight-Loss ad says, \u201cI lost 50 pounds in 6 months with QRS Weight-Loss.\u201d Very few QRS Weight-Loss users lose 50 pounds in 6 months and the ad truthfully discloses, \u201cThe typical weight loss of QRS Weight-Loss users who stick with the program for 6 months is 35 pounds.\u201d In fact, only one-fifth of those who start the QRS Weight-Loss program stick with it for 6 months. The disclosure is inadequate because it does not communicate what the typical outcome is for users who start the program. In other words, even with the disclosure, the ad does not communicate what people who join the QRS Weight-Loss program can generally expect.",
            "(vii) Assume that QRS Weight-Loss's manufacturer forwards reviews for its product to a third-party review website. If it forwards only favorable reviews or omits unfavorable reviews, it is engaging in a misleading practice.",
            "(5) Example 5. An advertisement presents the results of a poll of consumers who have used the advertiser's cake mixes as well as their own recipes. The results purport to show that the majority believed that their families could not tell the difference between the advertised mix and their own cakes baked from scratch. Many of the consumers are pictured in the advertisement along with relevant, quoted portions of their statements endorsing the product. This use of the results of a poll or survey of consumers represents that this is the typical result that ordinary consumers can expect from the advertiser's cake mix.",
            "(6) Example 6. An advertisement appears to show a \u201chidden camera\u201d situation in a crowded cafeteria at breakfast time. A spokesperson for the advertiser asks a series of patrons of the cafeteria for their spontaneous, honest opinions of the advertiser's recently introduced breakfast cereal. Even though none of the patrons is specifically identified during the advertisement, the net impression conveyed to consumers may well be that these are actual customers. If actors have been employed, this fact should be clearly and conspicuously disclosed.",
            "(7) Example 7. (i) An advertisement for a recently released motion picture shows three individuals coming out of a theater, each of whom gives a positive statement about the movie. These individuals are actual consumers expressing their personal views about the movie. The advertiser does not need to have substantiation that their views are representative of the opinions that most consumers will have about the movie. Because the consumers' statements would be understood to be the subjective opinions of only three people, this advertisement is not likely to convey a typicality message.",
            "(ii) If the motion picture studio had approached these individuals outside the theater and offered them free tickets if they would talk about the movie on camera afterwards or post about it on social media, that arrangement should be clearly and conspicuously disclosed. (See \u00a7 255.5.)",
            "(8) Example 8. (i) A camping goods retailer's website has various product pages. Each product page provides consumers with the opportunity to review the product and rate it on a five-star scale. Each such page displays the product's average star rating and a breakdown of the number of reviews with each star rating, followed by individual consumers' reviews and ratings. As such, the website is representing that it is providing an accurate reflection of the views of the purchasers who submitted product reviews to the website. If the retailer chose to suppress or otherwise not publish any reviews with fewer than four stars or reviews that contain negative sentiments, the product pages would be misleading as to purchasers' actual opinions of the products.",
            "(ii) If the retailer chose not to post reviews containing profanity, that would not be unfair or deceptive even if reviews containing profanity tend to be negative reviews. However, it would be misleading if the retailer blocked negative reviews containing profanity, but posted positive reviews containing profanity. It would be acceptable for the retailer to have a policy against posting reviews unrelated to the product at issue or related services, for example reviews complaining about the owner's policy positions. But it would be misleading if the retailer chose to filter reviews based on other factors that are only a pretext for filtering them based on negativity. Sellers are not required to display customer reviews that contain unlawful, harassing, abusive, obscene, vulgar, or sexually explicit content; the personal information or likeness of another person; content that is inappropriate with respect to race, gender, sexuality, or ethnicity; or reviews that the seller reasonably believes are fake, so long as the criteria for withholding reviews are applied uniformly to all reviews submitted. Neither are sellers required to display reviews that are unrelated to their products or services. A particular seller's customer service, delivery, returns, and exchanges are related to its products and services.",
            "(iii) Assume now that each product page starts with a glowing five-star review that is labeled as \u201cthe most helpful review.\u201d Labeling the review as the most helpful suggests it was voted most helpful by consumers visiting the website. If the initial review on each such page was selected by the retailer and was not selected as the most helpful review by other consumers, labeling it as the most helpful would be deceptive.",
            "(9) Example 9. A manufacturer offers to pay genuine purchasers $20 each to write positive reviews of its products on third-party review websites. Such reviews are deceptive even if the payment is disclosed because their positive nature is required by, rather than being merely influenced by, the payment. If, however, the manufacturer did not require the reviews to be positive and the reviewers understood that there were no negative consequences from writing negative reviews, a clear and conspicuous disclosure of the material connection would be appropriate. (See Example 6).",
            "(10) Example 10. (i) In an attempt to coerce them to delete their reviews, a manufacturer threatens consumers who post negative reviews of its products to third-party review websites, with physical threats, with the disclosure of embarrassing information, with baseless lawsuits (such as actions for defamation that challenge truthful speech or matters of opinion), or with lawsuits it actually does not intend to file. Such threats amount to an unfair or deceptive practice because other consumers would likely be deprived of information relevant to their decision to purchase or use the products, or be misled as to purchasers' actual opinions of the product.\n2",
            "(ii) Assume now that one of the third-party review websites has a reporting mechanism that allows businesses to flag suspected fake reviews. The manufacturer routinely flags negative reviews of its products as fake without a reasonable basis for believing that they actually are fake, resulting in truthful reviews being removed from the website. This misuse of the reporting option is an unfair or deceptive practice.",
            "(11) Example 11. A marketer contacts recent online, mail-order, and in-store purchasers of its products and asks them to provide feedback to the marketer. The marketer then invites purchasers who give very positive feedback to post online reviews of the products on third-party websites. Less pleased and unhappy purchasers are simply thanked for their feedback. Such a practice may be an unfair or deceptive practice if it results in the posted reviews being substantially more positive than if the marketer had not engaged in the practice. If, in the alternative, the marketer had simply invited all recent purchasers to provide feedback on third-party websites, the solicitation would not have been unfair or deceptive, even if it had expressed its hope for positive reviews."

            "(a) Whenever an advertisement represents, expressly or by implication, that the endorser is an expert with respect to the endorsement message, then the endorser's qualifications must in fact give the endorser the expertise that the endorser is represented as possessing with respect to the endorsement.",
            "(b) Although an expert may, in endorsing a product, take into account factors not within the endorser's expertise (such as taste or price), the endorsement must be supported by an actual exercise of the expertise that the expert is represented as possessing in evaluating product features or characteristics which are relevant to an ordinary consumer's use of or experience with the product. This evaluation must have included an examination or testing of the product at least as extensive as someone with the same degree of represented expertise would normally need to conduct in order to support the conclusions presented in the endorsement. To the extent that the advertisement implies that the endorsement was based upon a comparison to another product or other products, such comparison must have been included in the expert's evaluation; and as a result of such comparison, the expert must have concluded that, with respect to those features on which the endorser is represented to be an expert and which are relevant and available to an ordinary consumer, the endorsed product is at least equal overall to the competitors' products. Moreover, where the net impression created by the endorsement is that the advertised product is superior to other products with respect to any such feature or features, then the expert must in fact have found such superiority. (See \u00a7 255.1(e) regarding the liability of endorsers.)",
            "(c) Examples:",
            "(1) Example 1. An endorsement of a particular automobile by one described as an \u201cengineer\u201d implies that the endorser's professional training and experience are such that the endorser is well acquainted with the design and performance of automobiles. If the endorser's field is, for example, chemical engineering, the endorsement would be deceptive.",
            "(2) Example 2. An endorser of a hearing aid is simply referred to as a doctor during the course of an advertisement. The ad likely implies that the endorser has expertise in the area of hearing, as would be the case if the endorser is a medical doctor with substantial experience in audiology or a non-medical doctor with a Ph.D. or Au.D. in audiology. A doctor without substantial experience in the area of hearing might be able to endorse the product if the advertisement clearly and conspicuously discloses the nature and limits of the endorser's expertise.",
            "(3) Example 3. A manufacturer of automobile parts advertises that its products are approved by the \u201cAmerican Institute of Science.\u201d From its name, consumers would infer that the \u201cAmerican Institute of Science\u201d is a bona fide independent testing organization with expertise in judging automobile parts and that, as such, it would not approve any automobile part without first testing its performance by means of valid scientific methods. If the American Institute of Science is not such a bona fide independent testing organization (e.g., if it was established and operated by an automotive parts manufacturer), the endorsement would be deceptive. Even if the American Institute of Science is an independent bona fide expert testing organization, the endorsement may nevertheless be deceptive unless the Institute has conducted valid scientific tests of the advertised products and the test results support the endorsement message.",
            "(4) Example 4. A manufacturer of a non-prescription drug product represents that its product has been selected over competing products by a large metropolitan hospital. The hospital has selected the product because the manufacturer, unlike its competitors, has packaged each dose of the product separately. This package form is not generally available to the public. Under the circumstances, the endorsement would be deceptive because the basis for the hospital's choice\u2014convenience of packaging\u2014is neither relevant nor available to consumers, and the basis for the hospital's decision is not disclosed to consumers.",
            "(5) Example 5. A person who is identified as the president of a commercial \u201chome cleaning service\u201d states in a television advertisement for a particular brand of cleanser that the service uses that brand instead of its leading competitors because of its performance. Because cleaning services extensively use cleansers in the course of their business, the ad likely conveys that the president has knowledge superior to that of ordinary consumers. Accordingly, the president's statement will be deemed to be an expert endorsement. The service must, of course, actually use the endorsed cleanser. In addition, because the advertisement implies that the cleaning service has experience with a reasonable number of leading competitors' brands available to consumers, the service must, in fact, have such experience, and have determined, based on its expertise, that the endorsed product's cleaning ability is at least equal (or superior, if such is the net impression conveyed by the advertisement) to that of the leading competitors' products available to consumers. Because in this example the cleaning service's president makes no mention that the endorsed cleanser was \u201cchosen,\u201d \u201cselected,\u201d or otherwise evaluated in side-by-side comparisons against its competitors, it is sufficient if the service has relied solely upon its accumulated experience in evaluating cleansers without having performed side-by-side or scientific comparisons.",
            "(6) Example 6. A medical doctor states in an advertisement for a drug that the product will safely allow consumers to lower their cholesterol by 50 points. If the materials the doctor reviewed were merely letters from satisfied consumers or the results of a rodent study, the endorsement would likely be deceptive because those materials are not the type of scientific evidence that others with the represented degree of expertise would consider adequate to support this conclusion about the product's safety and efficacy. Under such circumstances, both the advertiser and the doctor would be liable for the doctor's misleading representation. (See \u00a7 255.1(d) and (e))."

            "(a) Endorsements by organizations, especially expert ones, are viewed as representing the judgment of a group whose collective experience exceeds that of any individual member, and whose judgments are generally free of the sort of subjective factors that vary from individual to individual. Therefore, an organization's endorsement must be reached by a process sufficient to ensure that the endorsement fairly reflects the collective judgment of the organization. Moreover, if an organization is represented as being expert, then, in conjunction with a proper exercise of its expertise in evaluating the product under \u00a7 255.3, it must utilize an expert or experts recognized as such by the organization or standards previously adopted by the organization and suitable for judging the relevant merits of such products. (See \u00a7 255.1(e) regarding the liability of endorsers.)",
            "(b) Examples:",
            "(1) Example 1. A mattress manufacturer advertises that its product is endorsed by a chiropractic association. Because the association would be regarded as expert with respect to judging mattresses, its endorsement must be supported by an evaluation by an expert or experts recognized as such by the organization, or by compliance with standards previously adopted by the organization and aimed at measuring the performance of mattresses in general and not designed with the unique features of the advertised mattress in mind.",
            "(2) Example 2. A trampoline manufacturer sets up and operates what appears to be a trampoline review website operated by an independent trampoline institute. The site reviews the manufacturer's trampolines, as well as those of competing manufacturers. Because the website falsely appears to be independent, it is deceptive. (See \u00a7 255.5.)",
            "(3) Example 3. (i) A third-party company operates a wireless headphone review website that provides rankings of different manufacturers' wireless headphones from most recommended to least recommended. The website operator accepts money from manufacturers in exchange for higher rankings of their products. Regardless of whether the website makes express claims of objectivity or independence, such paid-for rankings are deceptive and the website operator is liable for the deception. A headphone manufacturer who pays for a higher ranking on the website may also be held liable for the deception. A disclosure that the website operator receives payments from headphone manufacturers would be inadequate because the payments actually determine the headphones' relative rankings. If, however, the review website does not take payments for higher rankings, but receives payments from some of the headphone manufacturers, such as for affiliate link referrals, it should clearly and conspicuously disclose that it receives such payments. (See \u00a7 255.5(k)(11))",
            "(ii) Assume that the headphone review website operator uses a ranking methodology that results in higher rankings for products whose sellers have a relationship to the operator because of those relationships. The use of such a methodology is also misleading."

            "(a) When there exists a connection between the endorser and the seller of the advertised product that might materially affect the weight or credibility of the endorsement, and that connection is not reasonably expected by the audience, such connection must be disclosed clearly and conspicuously. Material connections can include a business, family, or personal relationship. They can include monetary payment or the provision of free or discounted products (including products unrelated to the endorsed product) to an endorser, regardless of whether the advertiser requires an endorsement in return. Material connections can also include other benefits to the endorser, such as early access to a product or the possibility of being paid, of winning a prize, or of appearing on television or in other media promotions. Some connections may be immaterial because they are too insignificant to affect the weight or credibility given to endorsements. A material connection needs to be disclosed when a significant minority of the audience for an endorsement does not understand or expect the connection. A disclosure of a material connection does not require the complete details of the connection, but it must clearly communicate the nature of the connection sufficiently for consumers to evaluate its significance.",
            "(b) Examples:",
            "(1) Example 1. A drug company commissions research on its product by an outside organization. The drug company determines the overall subject of the research (e.g., to test the efficacy of a newly developed product) and pays a substantial share of the expenses of the research project, but the research organization determines the protocol for the study and is responsible for conducting it. A subsequent advertisement by the drug company mentions the research results as the \u201cfindings\u201d of that research organization. Although the design and conduct of the research project are controlled by the outside research organization, the weight consumers place on the reported results could be materially affected by knowing that the advertiser had funded the project. Therefore, the advertiser's payment of expenses to the research organization should be disclosed in the advertisement.",
            "(2) Example 2. A film star endorses a particular food product in a television commercial. The endorsement regards only points of taste and individual preference. This endorsement must, of course, comply with \u00a7 255.1; but, regardless of whether the star's compensation for the commercial is a $1 million cash payment or a royalty for each product sold by the advertiser during the next year, no disclosure is required because such payments likely are ordinarily expected by viewers.",
            "(3) Example 3. (i) During an appearance by a well-known professional tennis player on a television talk show, the host comments that the past few months have been the best of the player's career and during this time the player has risen to their highest level ever in the rankings. The player responds by attributing that improvement to seeing the ball better ever since having laser vision correction surgery at a specific identified clinic. The athlete continues talking about the ease of the procedure, the kindness of the clinic's doctors, the short recovery time, and now being able to engage in a variety of activities without glasses, including driving at night. The athlete does not disclose having a contractual relationship with the clinic that includes payment for speaking publicly about the surgery. Consumers might not realize that a celebrity discussing a medical procedure in a television interview has been paid for doing so, and knowledge of such payments would likely affect the weight or credibility consumers give to the celebrity's endorsement. Without a clear and conspicuous disclosure during the interview that the athlete has been engaged as a spokesperson for the clinic, this endorsement is likely to be deceptive. A disclosure during the show's closing credits would not be clear and conspicuous. Furthermore, if consumers are likely to take away from the interview that the athlete's experience is typical of those who undergo the same procedure at the clinic, the advertiser must have substantiation for that claim.",
            "(ii) Assume that the tennis player instead touts the results of the surgery\u2014mentioning the clinic by name\u2014in the player's social media post. Consumers might not realize that the athlete is a paid endorser, and because that information might affect the weight consumers give to the tennis player's endorsement, the relationship with the clinic should be disclosed\u2014regardless of whether the clinic paid the athlete for that particular post. It should be disclosed even if the relationship involves no payments but only the tennis player getting the laser correction surgery for free or at a significantly reduced cost.",
            "(iii)(A) Assume that the clinic reposts the tennis player's social media post to its own social media account and that the player's original post either\u2014",

            "(2) Had such a disclosure that does not appear clearly and conspicuously in the repost.",
            "(B) Given the nature of the endorsement (i.e., a personally created statement from the tennis player's social media account), the viewing audience of the clinic's social media account would likely reasonably not expect the tennis player to be compensated. The clinic should clearly and conspicuously disclose its relationship to the athlete in its repost.",
            "(iv) Assume that during the appearance on the television talk show, the tennis player is wearing clothes bearing the insignia of an athletic wear company with which the athlete also has an endorsement contract. Although this contract requires wearing the company's clothes not only on the court but also in public appearances, when possible, the athlete does not mention the clothes or the company during the appearance on the show. No disclosure is required because no representation is being made about the clothes in this context.",
            "(4) Example 4. (i) A television ad for an anti-snoring product features a physician who says, \u201cI have seen dozens of products come on the market over the years, and in my opinion, this is the best ever.\u201d Consumers would expect the physician to be reasonably compensated for appearing in the ad. Consumers are unlikely, however, to expect that an expert endorser like the physician receives a percentage of gross product sales or owns part of the company, and either of these facts would likely materially affect the credibility that consumers attach to the endorsement. Accordingly, the advertisement should clearly and conspicuously disclose such a connection between the company and the physician.",
            "(ii) Assume that the physician is instead paid to post about the product on social media. In that context, consumers might not expect that the physician was compensated and might be more likely than in a television ad to expect that the physician is expressing an independent, professional opinion. Accordingly, the post should clearly and conspicuously disclose the doctor's connection with the company.",
            "(5) Example 5. (i) In a television advertisement, an actual patron of a restaurant, who is neither known to the public nor presented as an expert, is shown seated at the counter. The diner is asked for a \u201cspontaneous\u201d opinion of a new food product served in the restaurant. Assume, first, that the advertiser had posted a sign on the door of the restaurant informing all who entered that day that patrons would be interviewed by the advertiser as part of its television promotion of its new \u201cmeat-alternative\u201d burger. A patron seeing such a sign might be more inclined to give a positive review of that item in order to appear on television. The advertisement should thus clearly and conspicuously inform viewers that the patrons on screen knew in advance that they might appear in a television advertisement because that information may materially affect the weight or credibility of the endorsement.",
            "(ii) Assume, in the alternative, that the advertiser had not posted the sign and that patrons asked for their opinions about the burger did not know or have reason to believe until after their response that they were being recorded for use in an advertisement. No disclosure is required here, even if patrons were also told, after the interview, that they would be paid for allowing the use of their opinions in advertising.",
            "(6) Example 6. (i) An infomercial producer wants to include consumer endorsements in an infomercial for an automotive additive product not yet on the market. The producer's staff selects several people who work as \u201cextras\u201d in commercials and asks them to use the product and report back, telling them that they will be paid a small amount if selected to endorse the product in the infomercial. Viewers would not expect that these \u201cconsumer endorsers\u201d are actors who used the product in the hope of appearing in the commercial and receiving compensation. Because the advertisement fails to disclose these facts, it is deceptive.",
            "(ii) Assume that the additive's marketer wants to have more consumer reviews appear on its retail website, which sells a variety of its automotive products. The marketer recruits ordinary consumers to get a free product (e.g., a set of jumper cables or a portable air compressor for car tires) and a $30 payment in exchange for posting a consumer review of the free product on the marketer's website. The marketer makes clear and the reviewers understand that they are free to write negative reviews and that there are no negative consequences of doing so. Any resulting review that fails to clearly and conspicuously disclose the incentives provided to that reviewer is likely deceptive. When the resulting reviews must be positive or reviewers believe they might face negative consequences from posting negative reviews, a disclosure would be insufficient. (See \u00a7\u00a7 255.2(d) and (e)(9).) Even if adequate disclosures appear in each incentivized review, the practice could still be deceptive if the solicited reviews contain star ratings that are included in an average star rating for the product and including the incentivized reviews materially increases that average star rating. If such a material increase occurs, the marketer likely would need to provide a clear and conspicuous disclosure to people who see the average star rating.",
            "(7) Example 7. A woodworking influencer posts on-demand videos of various projects. A tool manufacturer sends the influencer an expensive full-size lathe in the hope that the influencer would post about it. The woodworker uses the lathe for several products and comments favorably about it in videos. If a significant minority of viewers are likely unaware that the influencer received the lathe free of charge, the woodworker should clearly and conspicuously disclose receiving it for free, a fact that could affect the credibility that viewers attach to the endorsements. The manufacturer should advise the woodworker at the time it provides the lathe that this connection should be disclosed, and it should have reasonable procedures in place to monitor the influencer's postings for compliance and follow those procedures. (See \u00a7 255.1(d).)",
            "(8) Example 8. An online community has a section dedicated to discussions of robotic products. Community members ask and answer questions and otherwise exchange information and opinions about robotic products and developments. Unbeknownst to this community, an employee of a leading home robot manufacturer has been posting messages on the discussion board promoting the manufacturer's new product. Knowledge of this poster's employment likely would affect the weight or credibility of the endorsements. Therefore, the poster should clearly and conspicuously disclose their relationship to the manufacturer. To limit its own liability for such posts, the employer should engage in appropriate training of employees. To the extent that the employer has directed such endorsements or otherwise has reason to know about them, it should also be monitoring them and taking other steps to ensure compliance. (See \u00a7 255.1(d).) The disclosure requirements in this example would apply equally to employees posting their own reviews of the product on retail websites or review platforms.",
            "(9) Example 9. A college student signs up to be part of a program in which points are awarded each time a participant posts on social media about a particular advertiser's products. Participants can then exchange their points for prizes, such as concert tickets or electronics. These incentives would materially affect the weight or credibility of the college student's endorsements. They should be clearly and conspicuously disclosed, and the advertiser should take steps to ensure that these disclosures are being provided.",
            "(10) Example 10. Great Paper Company sells photocopy paper with packaging that has a seal of approval from the No Chlorine Products Association, a non-profit third-party association. Great Paper Company paid the No Chlorine Products Association a reasonable fee for the evaluation of its product and its manufacturing process. Consumers would reasonably expect that marketers have to pay for this kind of certification. Therefore, there is no unexpected material connection between the company and the association, and the use of the seal without disclosure of the fee paid to the association would not be deceptive.",
            "(11) Example 11. A coffee lover creates a blog that reviews coffee makers. The blogger writes the content independently of the marketers of the coffee makers but includes affiliate links to websites on which consumers can buy these products from their marketers. Whenever a consumer clicks on such a link and buys the product, the blogger receives a portion of the sale. Because knowledge of this compensation could affect the weight or credibility site visitors give to the blogger's reviews, the reviews should clearly and conspicuously disclose the compensation.",
            "(12) Example 12. (i) Near the beginning of a podcast, the host reads what is obviously a commercial for a product. Even without a statement identifying the advertiser as a sponsor, listeners would likely still expect that the podcaster was compensated, so there is no need for a disclosure of payment for the commercial. Depending upon the language of the commercial, however, the audience may believe that the host is expressing their own views in the commercial, in which case the host would need to hold the views expressed. (See \u00a7 255.0(b).)",
            "(ii) Assume that the host also mentions the product in a social media post. The fact that the host did not have to make a disclosure in the podcast has no bearing on whether there has to be a disclosure in the social media post.",
            "(13) Example 13. An app developer gives a consumer a game app to review. The consumer clearly and conspicuously discloses in the review that they were given the app, which normally costs 99 cents, for free. That disclosure suggests that the consumer did not receive anything else for the review. If the app developer also gave the consumer $50 for the review, the mere disclosure that the app was free would be inadequate.",
            "(14) Example 14. Speed Ways, an internet Service Provider, advertises that it has the \u201cFastest ISP Service\u201d as determined by the \u201cData Speed Testing Company.\u201d If Speed Ways commissioned and paid for the analysis of its and competing services, it should clearly and conspicuously disclose its relationship to the testing company because the relationship would likely be material to consumers in evaluating the claim. If the \u201cData Speed Testing Company\u201d is not a bona fide independent testing organization with expertise in judging ISP speeds or it did not conduct valid tests that supported the endorsement message, the endorsement would also be deceptive.

Without such disclosures, consumers may incorrectly assume that they will achieve the mileage or range stated in the advertisement. In fact, their actual mileage or range will likely vary for many reasons, including driving conditions, driving habits, and vehicle maintenance. To address potential deception, advertisers may state that the values are \u201cEPA estimate(s),\u201d or use equivalent language that informs consumers that they will not necessarily achieve the stated MPG rating or driving range.",
            "(e) Disclosing EPA test as source of fuel economy and driving range estimates. Advertisers citing any EPA fuel economy or driving range figures should identify EPA as the source of the test so consumers understand that the estimate is comparable to EPA estimates for competing models. Doing so prevents deception by ensuring that consumers do not associate the claimed ratings with a test other than the EPA-required procedures. Advertisers may avoid deception by stating that the values are \u201cEPA estimate(s),\u201d or equivalent language that identifies the EPA test as the source.",
            "(f) Specifying driving modes for fuel economy estimates. If an advertiser cites an EPA fuel economy estimate, it should identify the particular type of driving associated with the estimate (i.e., estimated city, highway, or combined MPG). Advertisements failing to do so can deceive consumers who incorrectly assume the disclosure applies to a specific type of driving, such as combined or highway, which may not be the driving type the advertiser intended. Thus, such consumers may believe the model's fuel economy rating is higher than it actually is.",
            "(g) Within vehicle class comparisons. If an advertisement contains an express comparative fuel economy claim where the relevant comparison is to any group or class, other than all available automobiles, the advertisement should identify the group or class of vehicles used in the comparison. Without such qualifying information, many consumers are likely to assume that the advertisement compares the vehicle to all new automobiles.",
            "(h) Comparing different model types. Fuel economy estimates are assigned to specific model types under 40 CFR part 600, subpart D (i.e., unique combinations of car line, basic engine, and transmission class). Therefore, advertisers citing MPG ratings for certain models should ensure that the rating applies to the model type depicted in the advertisement. It is deceptive to state or imply that a rated fuel economy figure applies to a vehicle featured in an advertisement if the estimate does not apply to vehicles of that model type.",
            "(i) \u201cUp to\u201d claims. Advertisers should avoid using the term \u201cup to\u201d without adequate explanatory language if they intend to communicate that certain versions of a model (i.e., model types) are rated at a stated fuel economy estimate. A significant proportion of reasonable consumers are likely to interpret such claims to mean that the stated MPG can be achieved if the vehicle is driven under certain conditions. Therefore, to address the risk of deception, advertisers should qualify the claim by clearly and prominently disclosing the stated MPG applies to a particular vehicle model type.",
            "(j) Claims for flexible-fueled vehicles. Advertisements for flexible-fueled vehicles should not mislead consumers about the vehicle's fuel economy when operated with alternative fuel. If an advertisement for a flexible-fueled vehicle (other than a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle) mentions the vehicle's flexible-fuel capability and makes a fuel economy claim, it should clearly and prominently qualify the claim to identify the type of fuel used. Without such qualification, consumers are likely to take away that the stated fuel economy estimate applies to both gasoline and alternative fuel operation.",
            "(k) General driving range claims. General unqualified driving range claims, which do not reference a specific driving range estimate, are difficult for consumers to interpret and likely convey a wide range of meanings about a vehicle's range relative to other vehicles. Such claims, which inherently involve comparisons to other vehicles, can mislead consumers about the vehicle class included in the comparison as well as the extent to which the advertised vehicle's driving range differs from other models. Consumers may take away a range of reasonable interpretations from these claims. To avoid possible deception, advertisers making general driving range claims should disclose the advertised vehicle's EPA driving range estimate.",
            "(l) Use of non-EPA estimates\u2014(1) Disclosure content. Given consumers' exposure to EPA estimated fuel economy values over the last several decades, fuel economy and driving range estimates derived from non-EPA tests can lead to deception if consumers understand such estimates to be fuel economy ratings derived from EPA-required tests. Accordingly, advertisers should avoid such claims and disclose the EPA fuel economy or driving range estimates. However, if an advertisement includes a claim about a vehicle's fuel economy or driving range based on a non-EPA estimate, advertisers should disclose the EPA estimate and disclose with substantially more prominence than the non-EPA estimate:",
            "(i) That the fuel economy or driving range information is based on a non-EPA test;",
            "(ii) The source of the non-EPA test;",
            "(iii) The EPA fuel economy estimates or EPA driving range estimates for the vehicle; and",
            "(iv) All driving conditions or vehicle configurations simulated by the non-EPA test that are different from those used in the EPA test. Such conditions and variables may include, but are not limited to, road or dynamometer test, average speed, range of speed, hot or cold start, temperature, and design or equipment differences.",
            "(2) Disclosure format. The Commission regards the following as constituting \u201csubstantially more prominence\u201d:",
            "(i) For visual disclosures on television. If the fuel economy claims appear only in the visual portion, the EPA figures should appear in numbers twice as large as those used for any other estimate, and should remain on the screen at least as long as any other estimate. Each EPA figure should be broadcast against a solid color background that contrasts easily with the color used for the numbers when viewed on both color and black and white television.",
            "(ii) For audio disclosures. For radio and television advertisements in which any other estimate is used only in the audio, equal prominence should be given to the EPA figures. The Commission will regard the following as constituting equal prominence: The EPA estimated city and/or highway MPG should be stated, either before or after each disclosure of such other estimate, at least as audibly as such other estimate.",
            "(iii) For print and Internet disclosures. The EPA figures should appear in clearly legible type at least twice as large as that used for any other estimate. The EPA figures should appear against a solid color, and contrasting background. They may not appear in a footnote unless all references to fuel economy appear in a footnote."

            "(a) These guides set forth the Federal Trade Commission's current views about environmental claims. The guides help marketers avoid making environmental marketing claims that are unfair or deceptive under Section 5 of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. 45. They do not confer any rights on any person and do not operate to bind the FTC or the public. The Commission, however, can take action under the FTC Act if a marketer makes an environmental claim inconsistent with the guides. In any such enforcement action, the Commission must prove that the challenged act or practice is unfair or deceptive in violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act.",
            "(b) These guides do not preempt federal, state, or local laws. Compliance with those laws, however, will not necessarily preclude Commission law enforcement action under the FTC Act.",
            "(c) These guides apply to claims about the environmental attributes of a product, package, or service in connection with the marketing, offering for sale, or sale of such item or service to individuals. These guides also apply to business-to-business transactions. The guides apply to environmental claims in labeling, advertising, promotional materials, and all other forms of marketing in any medium, whether asserted directly or by implication, through words, symbols, logos, depictions, product brand names, or any other means.",
            "(d) The guides consist of general principles, specific guidance on the use of particular environmental claims, and examples. Claims may raise issues that are addressed by more than one example and in more than one section of the guides. The examples provide the Commission's views on how reasonable consumers likely interpret certain claims. The guides are based on marketing to a general audience. However, when a marketer targets a particular segment of consumers, the Commission will examine how reasonable members of that group interpret the advertisement. Whether a particular claim is deceptive will depend on the net impression of the advertisement, label, or other promotional material at issue. In addition, although many examples present specific claims and options for qualifying claims, the examples do not illustrate all permissible claims or qualifications under Section 5 of the FTC Act. Nor do they illustrate the only ways to comply with the guides. Marketers can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of Section 5 of the FTC Act. All examples assume that the described claims otherwise comply with Section 5. Where particularly useful, the Guides incorporate a reminder to this effect."

            "Section 5 of the FTC Act prohibits deceptive acts and practices in or affecting commerce. A representation, omission, or practice is deceptive if it is likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances and is material to consumers' decisions. See FTC Policy Statement on Deception, 103 FTC 174 (1983). To determine if an advertisement is deceptive, marketers must identify all express and implied claims that the advertisement reasonably conveys. Marketers must ensure that all reasonable interpretations of their claims are truthful, not misleading, and supported by a reasonable basis before they make the claims. See FTC Policy Statement Regarding Advertising Substantiation, 104 FTC 839 (1984). In the context of environmental marketing claims, a reasonable basis often requires competent and reliable scientific evidence. Such evidence consists of tests, analyses, research, or studies that have been conducted and evaluated in an objective manner by qualified persons and are generally accepted in the profession to yield accurate and reliable results. Such evidence should be sufficient in quality and quantity based on standards generally accepted in the relevant scientific fields, when considered in light of the entire body of relevant and reliable scientific evidence, to substantiate that each of the marketing claims is true."

            "The following general principles apply to all environmental marketing claims, including those described in \u00a7\u00a7 260.4 through 240.16. Claims should comport with all relevant provisions of these guides.",
            "(a) Qualifications and disclosures. To prevent deceptive claims, qualifications and disclosures should be clear, prominent, and understandable. To make disclosures clear and prominent, marketers should use plain language and sufficiently large type, should place disclosures in close proximity to the qualified claim, and should avoid making inconsistent statements or using distracting elements that could undercut or contradict the disclosure.",
            "(b) Distinction between benefits of product, package, and service. Unless it is clear from the context, an environmental marketing claim should specify whether it refers to the product, the product's packaging, a service, or just to a portion of the product, package, or service. In general, if the environmental attribute applies to all but minor, incidental components of a product or package, the marketer need not qualify the claim to identify that fact. However, there may be exceptions to this general principle. For example, if a marketer makes an unqualified recyclable claim, and the presence of the incidental component significantly limits the ability to recycle the product, the claim would be deceptive.",
            "(c) Overstatement of environmental attribute. An environmental marketing claim should not overstate, directly or by implication, an environmental attribute or benefit. Marketers should not state or imply environmental benefits if the benefits are negligible.",
            "(d) Comparative claims. Comparative environmental marketing claims should be clear to avoid consumer confusion about the comparison. Marketers should have substantiation for the comparison."

            "(a) It is deceptive to misrepresent, directly or by implication, that a product, package, or service offers a general environmental benefit.",
            "(b) Unqualified general environmental benefit claims are difficult to interpret and likely convey a wide range of meanings. In many cases, such claims likely convey that the product, package, or service has specific and far-reaching environmental benefits and may convey that the item or service has no negative environmental impact. Because it is highly unlikely that marketers can substantiate all reasonable interpretations of these claims, marketers should not make unqualified general environmental benefit claims.",
            "(c) Marketers can qualify general environmental benefit claims to prevent deception about the nature of the environmental benefit being asserted. To avoid deception, marketers should use clear and prominent qualifying language that limits the claim to a specific benefit or benefits. Marketers should not imply that any specific benefit is significant if it is, in fact, negligible. If a qualified general claim conveys that a product is more environmentally beneficial overall because of the particular touted benefit(s), marketers should analyze trade-offs resulting from the benefit(s) to determine if they can substantiate this claim.",
            "(d) Even if a marketer explains, and has substantiation for, the product's specific environmental attributes, this explanation will not adequately qualify a general environmental benefit claim if the advertisement otherwise implies deceptive claims. Therefore, marketers should ensure that the advertisement's context does not imply deceptive environmental claims."

Marketers may always qualify recyclable claims by stating the percentage of consumers or communities that have access to facilities that recycle the item. Alternatively, marketers may use qualifications that vary in strength depending on facility availability. The lower the level of access to an appropriate facility is, the more strongly the marketer should emphasize the limited availability of recycling for the product. For example, if recycling facilities are available to slightly less than a substantial majority of consumers or communities where the item is sold, a marketer may qualify a recyclable claim by stating: \u201cThis product [package] may not be recyclable in your area,\u201d or \u201cRecycling facilities for this product [package] may not exist in your area.\u201d If recycling facilities are available only to a few consumers, marketers should use stronger clarifications. For example, a marketer in this situation may qualify its recyclable claim by stating: \u201cThis product [package] is recyclable only in the few communities that have appropriate recycling facilities.\u201d",

The statement shall further disclose the customer's rights and obligations if the billing entity determines that no billing error occurred, including what action the billing entity may take if the customer continues to withhold payment of the disputed amount. Additionally, the statement shall inform the customer of the billing entity's obligation to forfeit any disputed amount (up to $50 per transaction) if the billing entity fails to follow the billing and collection procedures prescribed by \u00a7 308.7 of this rule.",

            "(iii) At the billing entity's option, additional information or explanations may be supplied with the disclosures required by \u00a7 308.7(n), but none shall be stated, utilized, or placed so as to mislead or confuse the customer or contradict, obscure, or detract attention from the information required to be disclosed. The disclosures required by \u00a7 308.7(n) shall appear separately and above any other disclosures.",
            "(o) Multiple billing entities. If a telephone-billed purchase involves more than one billing entity, only one set of disclosures need by given, and the billing entities shall agree among themselves which billing entity must comply with the requirements that this regulation imposes on any or all of them.

          "paragraphs": [
            "This section applies to textile wearing apparel.",
            "(a) Manufacturers and importers must attach care labels so that they can be seen or easily found when the product is offered for sale to consumers. If the product is packaged, displayed, or folded so that customers cannot see or easily find the label, the care information must also appear on the outside of the package or on a hang tag fastened to the product.",
            "(b) Care labels must state what regular care is needed for the ordinary use of the product. In general, labels for textile wearing apparel must have either a washing instruction or a drycleaning instruction. If a washing instruction is included, it must comply with the requirements set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. If a drycleaning instruction is included, it must comply with the requirements set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. If either washing or drycleaning can be used on the product, the label need have only one of these instructions. If the product cannot be cleaned by any available cleaning method without being harmed, the label must so state. [For example, if a product would be harmed both by washing and by drycleaning, the label might say \u201cDo not wash\u2014do not dryclean,\u201d or \u201cCannot be successfully cleaned.\u201d] The instructions for washing and drycleaning are as follows:",
            "(1) Washing, drying, ironing, bleaching and warning instructions must follow these requirements:",
            "(i) Washing. The label must state whether the product should be washed by hand or machine. The label must also state a water temperature\u2014in terms such as cold, warm, or hot\u2014that may be used. However, if the regular use of hot water up to 145 degrees F (63 degrees C) will not harm the product, the label need not mention any water temperature. [For example, Machine wash means hot, warm or cold water can be used.]",
            "(ii) Drying. The label must state whether the product should be dried by machine or by some other method. If machine drying is called for, the label must also state a drying temperature that may be used. However, if the regular use of a high temperature will not harm the product, the label need not mention any drying temperature. [For example, Tumble dry means that a high, medium, or low temperature setting can be used.]",
            "(iii) Ironing. Ironing must be mentioned on a label only if it will be needed on a regular basis to preserve the appearance of the product, or if it is required under paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section, Warnings. If ironing is mentioned, the label must also state an ironing temperature that may be used. However, if the regular use of a hot iron will not harm the product, the label need not mention any ironing temperature.",
            "(iv) Bleaching. (A) If all commercially available bleaches can safely be used on a regular basis, the label need not mention bleaching.",
            "(B) If all commercially available bleaches would harm the product when used on a regular basis, the label must say \u201cNo bleach\u201d or \u201cDo not bleach.\u201d",
            "(C) If regular use of chlorine bleach would harm the product, but regular use of a non-chlorine bleach would not, the label must say \u201cOnly non-chlorine bleach, when needed.\u201d",
            "(v) Warnings. (A) If there is any part of the prescribed washing procedure which consumers can reasonably be expected to use that would harm the product or others being washed with it in one or more washings, the label must contain a warning to this effect. The warning must use words \u201cDo not,\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d \u201cOnly,\u201d or some other clear wording. [For example, if a shirt is not colorfast, its label should state \u201cWash with like colors\u201d or \u201cWash separately.\u201d If a pair of pants will be harmed by ironing, its label should state \u201cDo not iron.\u201d]",
            "(B) Warnings are not necessary for any procedure that is an alternative to the procedure prescribed on the label. [For example, if an instruction states \u201cDry flat,\u201d it is not necessary to give the warning \u201cDo not tumble dry.\u201d]",
            "(2) Drycleaning\u2014(i) General. If a drycleaning instruction is included on the label, it must also state at least one type of solvent that may be used. However, if all commercially available types of solvent can be used, the label need not mention any types of solvent. The terms \u201cDrycleanable\u201d or \u201cCommercially Dryclean\u201d may not be used in an instruction. [For example, if drycleaning in perchlorethylene would harm a coat, the label might say \u201cProfessionally dryclean: fluorocarbon or petroleum.\u201d]",
            "(ii) Warnings. (A) If there is any part of the drycleaning procedure which consumers or drycleaners can reasonably be expected to use that would harm the product or others being cleaned with it, the label must contain a warning to this effect. The warning must use the words \u201cDo not,\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d \u201cOnly,\u201d or some other clear wording. [For example, the drycleaning process normally includes moisture addition to solvent up to 75% relative humidity, hot tumble drying up to 160 degrees F and restoration by steam press or steam-air finish. If a product can be drycleaned in all solvents but steam should not be used, its label should state \u201cProfessionally dryclean. No steam.\u201d]",
            "(B) Warnings are not necessary to any procedure which is an alternative to the procedure prescribed on the label. [For example, if an instruction states \u201cProfessionally dryclean, fluorocarbon,\u201d it is not necessary to give the warning \u201cDo not use perchlorethylene.\u201d]",
            "(c) A manufacturer or importer must establish a reasonable basis for care information by processing prior to sale:",
            "(1) Reliable evidence that the product was not harmed when cleaned reasonably often according to the instructions on the label, including instructions when silence has a meaning. [For example, if a shirt is labeled \u201cMachine wash. Tumble dry. Cool iron.,\u201d the manufacturer or importer must have reliable proof that the shirt is not harmed when cleaned by machine washing (in hot water), with any type of bleach, tumble dried (at a high setting), and ironed with a cool iron]; or",
            "(2) Reliable evidence that the product or a fair sample of the product was harmed when cleaned by methods warned against on the label. However, the manufacturer or importer need not have proof of harm when silence does not constitute a warning. [For example, if a shirt is labeled \u201cMachine wash warm. Tumble dry medium\u201d, the manufacturer need not have proof that the shirt would be harmed if washed in hot water or dried on high setting]; or",
            "(3) Reliable evidence, like that described in paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section, for each component part of the product in conjunction with reliable evidence for the garment as a whole; or",
            "(4) Reliable evidence that the product or a fair sample of the product was successfully tested. The tests may simulate the care suggested or warned against on the label; or",
            "(5) Reliable evidence of current technical literature, past experience, or the industry expertise supporting the care information on the label; or",
            "(6) Other reliable evidence."

The alternate simple mechanism required by this paragraph must satisfy all requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section, as applicable.

At that point, if the manufacturer of the bulk elects to use his name on the label of the consumer commodity, his name should be qualified to show \u201cDistributed by ______________\u201d, or \u201cManufactured for __________________\u201d.",

This is true whether the person or firm who supplies the formula or specifications, or both, also supplies the raw materials which are to be reacted, mixed, or otherwise modified to produce the consumer commodity.",

Such qualification may be \u201cManufactured for ____________\u201d, \u201cDistributed by ______________\u201d, or \u201cManufactured by ______________ (XYZ, Inc., City, State, Zip Code, a subsidiary of ABC, Inc.)\u201d."

            "(a) When a consumer commodity is properly measured in terms of count only, or in terms of count and weight, volume, area, or dimension, the regulations are interpreted not to require the declaration of the net content as \u201cone\u201d, provided the statement of identity clearly expresses the fact that only one unit is contained in the package. Thus the unit synthetic sponge, the unit light bulb, and the unit dry cell battery do not require a net quantity statement of \u201cone sponge,\u201d \u201cone light bulb,\u201d or \u201cone dry cell battery.\u201d However, there still exists the necessity to provide a net quantity statement to specify weight, volume, area, or dimensions when such are required. For example, the synthetic sponge which is packaged, requires dimensions such as \u201c5 in. \u00d7 3 in. \u00d7 1 in.\u201d A multicomponent package or a package containing two or more units of the same commodity shall bear the net quantity statement in terms of count, and weight, volume, area, or dimensions as required.

            "(d) As to these articles, products, or commodities subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission, the legislative history of the Act demonstrates the intent of Congress, for the reasons stated therein, to place the following categories outside the scope of the definition of \u201cconsumer commodity\u201d:",
            "(1) Durable articles or commodities;",
            "(2) Textiles or items of apparel;",
            "(3) Any household appliance, equipment, or furnishing, including feather and down-filled products, synthetic-filled bed pillows, mattress pads and patchwork quilts, comforters and decorative curtains;",

            "(1) Consumption by individuals. This term as it is used in section 10(a) means the using up of an article, product, or commodity by an individual.",
            "(2) Use by individuals. This term as it is used in section 10(a) means the employment or application of an article, product, or commodity by an individual.",
            "(3) Personal care by individuals. This term as it is used in section 10(a) means that activity of an individual which is concerned with protecting, enhancing, and providing for the general cleanliness, health, or appearance of the individual.",

As questions arise as to whether specific articles, products, or commodities are included in the above definition, the Commission will consider, among other things, the Congressional policy declared in section 2 of the Act, namely, that packages and labels should enable consumers to obtain accurate information as to the quantity of contents and should facilitate value comparisons. That is, in making its determinations of inclusions and exclusions under this definition, the Commission will consider the requirements of both the Act and the pertinent regulations and in that connection will regard as one criterion the extent to which the disclosures required on \u201cconsumer commodities\u201d are material to a consumer's selection of a particular article, product, or commodity. Interpretative rulings in such instances will be made public, and can be expected to further contribute to the development of clearer delineation of the scope of the term \u201cconsumer commodity\u201d.",

            "(a) In general. Except as otherwise provided in this part, a motor vehicle dealer must provide to a consumer a notice (\u201crisk-based pricing notice\u201d) in the form and manner required by this part if the motor vehicle dealer both\u2014",

            "(b) Determining which consumers must receive a notice. A motor vehicle dealer may determine whether paragraph (a) of this section applies by directly comparing the material terms offered to each consumer and the material terms offered to other consumers for a specific type of credit product. For purposes of this section, a \u201cspecific type of credit product\u201d means one or more credit products with similar features designed for similar purposes. Examples of a specific type of credit product include new automobile loans and used automobile loans. As an alternative to making this direct comparison, a motor vehicle dealer may make the determination by using one of the following methods:",
            "(1) Credit score proxy method\u2014(i) In general. A motor vehicle dealer that sets the material terms of credit granted, extended, or otherwise provided to a consumer, based in whole or in part on a credit score, may comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section by\u2014",
            "(A) Determining the credit score (hereafter referred to as the \u201ccutoff score\u201d) that represents the point at which approximately 40 percent of the consumers to whom it grants, extends, or provides credit have higher credit scores and approximately 60 percent of the consumers to whom it grants, extends, or provides credit have lower credit scores; and",
            "(B) Providing a risk-based pricing notice to each consumer to whom it grants, extends, or provides credit whose credit score is lower than the cutoff score.",
            "(ii) Alternative to the 40/60 cutoff score determination. In the case of credit that has been granted, extended, or provided on the most favorable material terms to more than 40 percent of consumers, a motor vehicle dealer may, at its option, set its cutoff score at a point at which the approximate percentage of consumers who historically have been granted, extended, or provided credit on material terms other than the most favorable terms would receive risk-based pricing notices under this section.",
            "(iii) Determining the cutoff score\u2014(A) Sampling approach. A motor vehicle dealer that currently uses risk-based pricing with respect to the credit products it offers must calculate the cutoff score by considering the credit scores of all or a representative sample of the consumers to whom it has granted, extended, or provided credit for a specific type of credit product.",
            "(B) Secondary source approach in limited circumstances. A motor vehicle dealer that is a new entrant into the credit business, introduces new credit products, or starts to use risk-based pricing with respect to the credit products it currently offers may initially determine the cutoff score based on information derived from appropriate market research or relevant third-party sources for a specific type of credit product, such as research or data from companies that develop credit scores. A motor vehicle dealer that acquires a credit portfolio as a result of a merger or acquisition may determine the cutoff score based on information from the party which it acquired, with which it merged, or from which it acquired the portfolio.",
            "(C) Recalculation of cutoff scores. A motor vehicle dealer using the credit score proxy method must recalculate its cutoff score(s) no less than every two years in the manner described in paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(A) of this section. A motor vehicle dealer using the credit score proxy method using market research, third-party data, or information from a party which it acquired, with which it merged, or from which it acquired the portfolio as permitted by paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(B) of this section generally must calculate a cutoff score(s) based on the scores of its own consumers in the manner described in paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(A) of this section within one year after it begins using a cutoff score derived from market research, third-party data, or information from a party which it acquired, with which it merged, or from which it acquired the portfolio. If such a motor vehicle dealer does not grant, extend, or provide credit to new consumers during that one-year period such that it lacks sufficient data with which to recalculate a cutoff score based on the credit scores of its own consumers, the motor vehicle dealer may continue to use a cutoff score derived from market research, third-party data, or information from a party which it acquired, with which it merged, or from which it acquired the portfolio as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(B) until it obtains sufficient data on which to base the recalculation. However, the motor vehicle dealer must recalculate its cutoff score(s) in the manner described in paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(A) of this section within two years, if it has granted, extended, or provided credit to some new consumers during that two-year period.",
            "(D) Use of two or more credit scores. A motor vehicle dealer that generally uses two or more credit scores in setting the material terms of credit granted, extended, or provided to a consumer must determine the cutoff score using the same method the motor vehicle dealer uses to evaluate multiple scores when making credit decisions. These evaluation methods may include, but are not limited to, selecting the low, median, high, most recent, or average credit score of each consumer to whom it grants, extends, or provides credit. If a motor vehicle dealer that uses two or more credit scores does not consistently use the same method for evaluating multiple credit scores (e.g., if the motor vehicle dealer sometimes chooses the median score and other times calculates the average score), the motor vehicle dealer must determine the cutoff score using a reasonable means. In such cases, use of any one of the methods that the motor vehicle dealer regularly uses or the average credit score of each consumer to whom it grants, extends, or provides credit is deemed to be a reasonable means of calculating the cutoff score.",
            "(iv) Credit score not available. For purposes of this section, a motor vehicle dealer using the credit score proxy method who grants, extends, or provides credit to a consumer for whom a credit score is not available must assume that the consumer receives credit on material terms that are materially less favorable than the most favorable credit terms offered to a substantial proportion of consumers from or through that motor vehicle dealer and must provide a risk-based pricing notice to the consumer.",
            "(v) Examples. (A) A motor vehicle dealer engages in risk-based pricing and the annual percentage rates it offers to consumers are based in whole or in part on a credit score. The motor vehicle dealer takes a representative sample of the credit scores of consumers to whom it extended loans within the preceding three months. The motor vehicle dealer determines that approximately 40 percent of the sampled consumers have a credit score at or above 720 (on a scale of 350 to 850) and approximately 60 percent of the sampled consumers have a credit score below 720. Thus, the motor vehicle dealer selects 720 as its cutoff score. A consumer applies to the motor vehicle dealer for a loan. The motor vehicle dealer obtains a credit score for the consumer. The consumer's credit score is 700. Since the consumer's 700 credit score falls below the 720 cutoff score, the motor vehicle dealer must provide a risk-based pricing notice to the consumer.",
            "(B) A motor vehicle dealer engages in risk-based pricing, and the annual percentage rates it offers to consumers are based in whole or in part on a credit score. The motor vehicle dealer takes a representative sample of the consumers to whom it extended loans over the preceding six months. The motor vehicle dealer determines that approximately 80 percent of the sampled consumers received credit at its lowest annual percentage rate, and 20 percent received credit at a higher annual percentage rate. Approximately 80 percent of the sampled consumers have a credit score at or above 750 (on a scale of 350 to 850), and 20 percent have a credit score below 750. Thus, the motor vehicle dealer selects 750 as its cutoff score. A consumer applies to the motor vehicle dealer for an automobile loan. The motor vehicle dealer obtains a credit score for the consumer. The consumer's credit score is 740. Since the consumer's 740 credit score falls below the 750 cutoff score, the motor vehicle dealer must provide a risk-based pricing notice to the consumer.",
            "(C) A motor vehicle dealer engages in risk-based pricing, obtains credit scores from one of the nationwide consumer reporting agencies, and uses the credit score proxy method to determine which consumers must receive a risk-based pricing notice. A consumer applies to the motor vehicle dealer for credit to finance the purchase of an automobile. A credit score about that consumer is not available from the consumer reporting agency from which the lender obtains credit scores. The motor vehicle dealer nevertheless grants, extends, or provides credit to the consumer. The motor vehicle dealer must provide a risk-based pricing notice to the consumer.",
            "(2) Tiered pricing method\u2014(i) In general. A motor vehicle dealer that sets the material terms of credit granted, extended, or provided to a consumer by placing the consumer within one of a discrete number of pricing tiers for a specific type of credit product, based in whole or in part on a consumer report, may comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section by providing a risk-based pricing notice to each consumer who is not placed within the top pricing tier or tiers, as described below.",
            "(ii) Four or fewer pricing tiers. If a motor vehicle dealer using the tiered pricing method has four or fewer pricing tiers, the motor vehicle dealer complies with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section by providing a risk-based pricing notice to each consumer to whom it grants, extends, or provides credit who does not qualify for the top tier (that is, the lowest-priced tier). For example, a motor vehicle dealer that uses a tiered pricing structure with annual percentage rates of 8, 10, 12, and 14 percent would provide the risk-based pricing notice to each consumer to whom it grants, extends, or provides credit at annual percentage rates of 10, 12, and 14 percent.",
            "(iii) Five or more pricing tiers. If a motor vehicle dealer using the tiered pricing method has five or more pricing tiers, the motor vehicle dealer complies with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section by providing a risk-based pricing notice to each consumer to whom it grants, extends, or provides credit who does not qualify for the top two tiers (that is, the two lowest-priced tiers) and any other tier that, together with the top tiers, comprise no less than the top 30 percent but no more than the top 40 percent of the total number of tiers. Each consumer placed within the remaining tiers must receive a risk-based pricing notice. For example, if a motor vehicle dealer has nine pricing tiers, the top three tiers (that is, the three lowest-priced tiers) comprise no less than the top 30 percent but no more than the top 40 percent of the tiers. Therefore, a motor vehicle dealer using this method would provide a risk-based pricing notice to each consumer to whom it grants, extends, or provides credit who is placed within the bottom six tiers.",
            "(c) Application to credit card issuers\u2014(1) In general. A credit card issuer subject to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section may use one of the methods set forth in paragraph (b) of this section to identify consumers to whom it must provide a risk-based pricing notice. Alternatively, a credit card issuer may satisfy its obligations under paragraph (a) of this section by providing a risk-based pricing notice to a consumer when\u2014",
            "(i) A consumer applies for a credit card either in connection with an application program, such as a direct-mail offer or a take-one application, or in response to a solicitation under 12 CFR 226.5a, and more than a single possible purchase annual percentage rate may apply under the program or solicitation; and",
            "(ii) Based in whole or in part on a consumer report, the credit card issuer provides a credit card to the consumer with an annual percentage rate referenced in \u00a7 640.2(n)(1)(ii) that is greater than the lowest annual percentage rate referenced in \u00a7 640.2(n)(1)(ii) available in connection with the application or solicitation.",
            "(2) No requirement to compare different offers. A credit card issuer is not subject to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section and is not required to provide a risk-based pricing notice to a consumer if\u2014",
            "(i) The consumer applies for a credit card for which the card issuer provides a single annual percentage rate referenced in \u00a7 640.2(n)(1)(ii), excluding a temporary initial rate lower than the rate that will apply after the temporary rate expires and a penalty rate that will apply upon the occurrence of one or more specific events, such as a late payment or an extension of credit that exceeds the credit limit; or",
            "(ii) The credit card issuer offers the consumer the lowest annual percentage rate referenced in \u00a7 640.2(n)(1)(ii) available under the credit card offer for which the consumer applied, even if a lower annual percentage rate referenced in \u00a7 640.2(n)(1)(ii) is available under a different credit card offer issued by the card issuer.",
            "(3) Examples. (i) A credit card issuer sends a solicitation to the consumer that discloses several possible purchase annual percentage rates that may apply, such as 10, 12, or 14 percent, or a range of purchase annual percentage rates from 10 to 14 percent. The consumer applies for a credit card in response to the solicitation. The card issuer provides a credit card to the consumer with a purchase annual percentage rate of 12 percent based in whole or in part on a consumer report. Unless an exception applies under \u00a7 640.5, the card issuer may satisfy its obligations under paragraph (a) of this section by providing a risk-based pricing notice to the consumer because the consumer received credit at a purchase annual percentage rate greater than the lowest purchase annual percentage rate available under that solicitation.",
            "(ii) The same facts as in the example in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, except that the card issuer provides a credit card to the consumer at a purchase annual percentage rate of 10 percent. The card issuer is not required to provide a risk-based pricing notice to the consumer even if, under a different credit card solicitation, that consumer or other consumers might qualify for a purchase annual percentage rate of 8 percent.",
            "(d) Account review\u2014(1) In general. Except as otherwise provided in this part, a motor vehicle dealer is subject to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section and must provide a risk-based pricing notice to a consumer in the form and manner required by this part if the motor vehicle dealer\u2014",
            "(i) Uses a consumer report in connection with a review of credit that has been extended to the consumer; and",
            "(ii) Based in whole or in part on the consumer report, increases the annual percentage rate (the annual percentage rate referenced in \u00a7 640.2(n)(1)(ii) in the case of a credit card).",
            "(2) Example. A credit card issuer periodically obtains consumer reports for the purpose of reviewing the terms of credit it has extended to consumers in connection with credit cards. As a result of this review, the credit card issuer increases the purchase annual percentage rate applicable to a consumer's credit card based in whole or in part on information in a consumer report. The credit card issuer is subject to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section and must provide a risk-based pricing notice to the consumer."

For purposes of this section, \u201cspecific material terms\u201d means a single material term, or set of material terms, such as an annual percentage rate of 10 percent, and not a range of alternatives, such as an annual percentage rate that may be 8, 10, or 12 percent, or between 8 and 12 percent.",
            "(2) Example. A consumer receives a firm offer of credit from a motor vehicle dealer. The terms of the firm offer are based in whole or in part on information from a consumer report the motor vehicle dealer obtained under the FCRA's firm offer of credit provisions. The solicitation offers the consumer a loan with an annual percentage rate of 12 percent. The consumer applies for and receives a loan with an annual percentage rate of 12 percent. Other customers of the motor vehicle dealer have an annual percentage rate of 10 percent. The exception applies because the consumer applied for specific material terms and was granted those terms. Although the motor vehicle dealer specified the annual percentage rate in the firm offer of credit based in whole or in part on a consumer report, the motor vehicle dealer specified that material term before, not after, the consumer applied for or requested credit.",

            "(2) More favorable material terms. This exception applies to any firm offer of credit offered by a motor vehicle dealer to a consumer, even if the motor vehicle dealer makes other firm offers of credit to other consumers on more favorable material terms.",
            "(3) Example. A motor vehicle dealer obtains two prescreened lists from a consumer reporting agency. One list includes consumers with high credit scores. The other list includes consumers with low credit scores. The motor vehicle dealer mails a firm offer of credit to the high credit score consumers with an annual percentage rate of 10 percent. The motor vehicle dealer also mails a firm offer of credit to the low credit score consumers with an annual percentage rate of 14 percent. The motor vehicle dealer is not required to provide a risk-based pricing notice to the low credit score consumers who receive the 14 percent offer because use of a consumer report to make a firm offer of credit does not trigger the risk-based pricing notice requirement.",

If the motor vehicle dealer is the person to whom the loan obligation is initially payable, such as where the motor vehicle dealer is the original creditor under a retail installment sales contract, the motor vehicle dealer must provide the risk-based pricing notice to the consumer (or satisfy the requirements for and provide the notice required under one of the exceptions noted above), even if the motor vehicle dealer immediately assigns the loan to a bank or finance company. The bank or finance company, which is an assignee, has no duty to provide a risk-based pricing notice to the consumer.",
            "(ii) A consumer obtains credit to finance the purchase of an automobile. If a bank or finance company is the person to whom the loan obligation is initially payable, the bank or finance company must provide the risk-based pricing notice to the consumer (or satisfy the requirements for and provide the notice required under one of the exceptions noted above) based on the terms offered by that bank or finance company only. The motor vehicle dealer has no duty to provide a risk-based pricing notice to the consumer. However, the bank or finance company may comply with this rule if the motor vehicle dealer has agreed to provide notices to consumers before consummation pursuant to an arrangement with the bank or finance company, as permitted under \u00a7 640.4(c).",
            "(c) Multiple consumers\u2014(1) Risk-based pricing notices. In a transaction involving two or more consumers who are granted, extended, or otherwise provided credit, a motor vehicle dealer must provide a notice to each consumer to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 640.3(a) or (c). Whether the consumers have the same address or not, the motor vehicle dealer must provide a separate notice to each consumer if a notice includes a credit score(s). Each separate notice that includes a credit score(s) must contain only the credit score(s) of the consumer to whom the notice is provided, and not the credit score(s) of the other consumer. If the consumers have the same address, and the notice does not include a credit score(s), a motor vehicle dealer may satisfy the requirements by providing a single notice addressed to both consumers.",
            "(2) Credit score disclosure notices. In a transaction involving two or more consumers who are granted, extended, or otherwise provided credit, a motor vehicle dealer must provide a separate notice to each consumer to satisfy the exceptions in \u00a7 640.5(d), (e), or (f). Whether the consumers have the same address or not, the motor vehicle dealer must provide a separate notice to each consumer. Each separate notice must contain only the credit score(s) of the consumer to whom the notice is provided, and not the credit score(s) of the other consumer.",
            "(3) Examples. (i) Two consumers jointly apply for credit with a creditor. The creditor obtains credit scores on both consumers. Based in part on the credit scores, the creditor grants credit to the consumers on material terms that are materially less favorable than the most favorable terms available to other consumers from the creditor. The creditor provides risk-based pricing notices to satisfy its obligations under this subpart. The creditor must provide a separate risk-based pricing notice to each consumer whether the consumers have the same address or not. Each risk-based pricing notice must contain only the credit score(s) of the consumer to whom the notice is provided.",
            "(ii) Two consumers jointly apply for credit with a creditor. The two consumers reside at the same address. The creditor obtains credit scores on each of the two consumer applicants. The creditor grants credit to the consumers. The creditor provides credit score disclosure notices to satisfy its obligations under this part. Even though the two consumers reside at the same address, the creditor must provide a separate credit score disclosure notice to each of the consumers. Each notice must contain only the credit score of the consumer to whom the notice is provided."

            "(iii) An inquiry or application by the consumer regarding a product or service offered by that person during the three-month period immediately preceding the date on which the consumer is sent a solicitation covered by this part.",
            "(2) Examples of pre-existing business relationships. (i) If a consumer has an existing loan account with a creditor, the creditor has a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer and can use eligibility information it receives from its affiliates to make solicitations to the consumer about its products or services.",
            "(ii) If a consumer obtained a mortgage from a mortgage lender, but refinanced the mortgage loan with a different lender when the mortgage loan came due, the first mortgage lender has a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer and can use eligibility information it receives from its affiliates to make solicitations to the consumer about its products or services for 18 months after the date the outstanding balance of the loan is paid and the loan is closed.",
            "(iii) If a consumer obtains a mortgage, the mortgage lender has a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer. If the mortgage lender sells the consumer's entire loan to an investor, the mortgage lender has a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer and can use eligibility information it receives from its affiliates to make solicitations to the consumer about its products or services for 18 months after the date it sells the loan, and the investor has a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer upon purchasing the loan. If, however, the mortgage lender sells a fractional interest in the consumer's loan to an investor but also retains an ownership interest in the loan, the mortgage lender continues to have a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer, but the investor does not have a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer. If the mortgage lender retains ownership of the loan, but sells ownership of the servicing rights to the consumer's loan, the mortgage lender continues to have a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer. The purchaser of the servicing rights also has a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer as of the date it purchases ownership of the servicing rights, but only if it collects payments from or otherwise deals directly with the consumer on a continuing basis.",
            "(iv) If a consumer applies to a creditor for a product or service that it offers, but does not obtain a product or service from or enter into a financial contract or transaction with the creditor, the creditor has a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer and can therefore use eligibility information it receives from an affiliate to make solicitations to the consumer about its products or services for three months after the date of the application.",
            "(v) If a consumer makes a telephone inquiry to a creditor about its products or services and provides contact information to the creditor, but does not obtain a product or service from or enter into a financial contract or transaction with the creditor, the creditor has a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer and can therefore use eligibility information it receives from an affiliate to make solicitations to the consumer about its products or services for three months after the date of the inquiry.",
            "(vi) If a consumer makes an inquiry to a creditor by e-mail about its products or services, but does not obtain a product or service from or enter into a financial contract or transaction with the creditor, the creditor has a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer and can therefore use eligibility information it receives from an affiliate to make solicitations to the consumer about its products or services for three months after the date of the inquiry.",
            "(vii) If a consumer has an existing relationship with a creditor that is part of a group of affiliated companies, makes a telephone call to the centralized call center for the group of affiliated companies to inquire about products or services offered by the insurance affiliate, and provides contact information to the call center, the call constitutes an inquiry to the insurance affiliate that offers those products or services. The insurance affiliate has a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer and can therefore use eligibility information it receives from its affiliated creditor to make solicitations to the consumer about its products or services for three months after the date of the inquiry.",
            "(3) Examples where no pre-existing business relationship is created. (i) If a consumer makes a telephone call to a centralized call center for a group of affiliated companies to inquire about the consumer's existing account with a creditor, the call does not constitute an inquiry to any affiliate other than the creditor that holds the consumer's account and does not establish a pre-existing business relationship between the consumer and any affiliate of the account-holding creditor.",
            "(ii) If a consumer who has a loan account with a creditor makes a telephone call to an af-filiate of the creditor to ask about the affiliate's retail locations and hours, but does not make an inquiry about the affiliate's products or services, the call does not constitute an inquiry and does not establish a pre-existing business relationship between the consumer and the affiliate. Also, the affiliate's capture of the consumer's telephone number does not constitute an inquiry and does not establish a pre-existing business relationship between the consumer and the affiliate.",
            "(iii) If a consumer makes a telephone call to a creditor in response to an advertisement that offers a free promotional item to consumers who call a toll-free number, but the advertisement does not indicate that creditor's products or services will be marketed to consumers who call in response, the call does not create a pre-existing business relationship between the consumer and the creditor because the consumer has not made an inquiry about a product or service offered by the creditor, but has merely responded to an offer for a free promotional item.",
            "(l) Solicitation\u2014(1) In general. The term \u201csolicitation\u201d means the marketing of a product or service initiated by a person to a particular consumer that is\u2014",
            "(i) Based on eligibility information communicated to that person by its affiliate as described in this part; and",
            "(ii) Intended to encourage the consumer to purchase or obtain such product or service.",
            "(2) Exclusion of marketing directed at the general public. A solicitation does not include marketing communications that are directed at the general public. For example, television, general circulation magazine, and billboard advertisements do not constitute solicitations, even if those communications are intended to encourage consumers to purchase products and services from the person initiating the communications.",
            "(3) Examples of solicitations. A solicitation would include, for example, a telemarketing call, direct mail, e-mail, or other form of marketing communication directed to a particular consumer that is based on eligibility information received from an affiliate.",

            "(iii) As a result of your use of the eligibility information, the consumer is provided a solicitation.",
            "(2) Receiving eligibility information from an affiliate, including through a common database. You may receive eligibility information from an affiliate in various ways, including when the affiliate places that information into a common database that you may access.",

All relevant facts and circumstances will determine whether a person is acting as your service provider when it receives or uses an affiliate's eligibility information in connection with marketing your products and services.",
            "(4) Use by an affiliate of its own eligibility information. Unless you have used eligibility information that you receive from an affiliate in the manner described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, you do not make a solicitation subject to this part if your affiliate:",
            "(i) Uses its own eligibility information that it obtained in connection with a pre-existing business relationship it has or had with the consumer to market your products or services to the consumer; or",

            "(5) Use of eligibility information by a service provider\u2014(i) In general. You do not make a solicitation subject to this part if a service provider (including an affiliated or third-party service provider that maintains or accesses a common database that you may access) receives eligibility information from your affiliate that your affiliate obtained in connection with a pre-existing business relationship it has or had with the consumer and uses that eligibility information to market your products or services to the consumer, so long as\u2014",
            "(A) Your affiliate controls access to and use of its eligibility information by the service provider (including the right to establish the specific terms and conditions under which the service provider may use such information to market your products or services);",
            "(B) Your affiliate establishes specific terms and conditions under which the service provider may access and use the affiliate's eligibility information to market your products and services (or those of affiliates generally) to the consumer, such as the identity of the affiliated companies whose products or services may be marketed to the consumer by the service provider, the types of products or services of affiliated companies that may be marketed, and the number of times the consumer may receive marketing materials, and periodically evaluates the service provider's compliance with those terms and conditions;",

            "(D) Your affiliate is identified on or with the marketing materials provided to the consumer; and",
            "(E) You do not directly use your affiliate's eligibility information in the manner described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.",
            "(ii) Writing requirements. (A) The requirements of paragraphs (b)(5)(i)(A) and (C) of this section must be set forth in a written agreement between your affiliate and the service provider; and",
            "(B) The specific terms and conditions established by your affiliate as provided in paragraph (b)(5)(i)(B) of this section must be set forth in writing.",
            "(6) Examples of making solicitations. (i) A consumer has a loan account with a creditor, which is affiliated with an insurance company. The insurance company receives eligibility information about the consumer from the creditor. The insurance company uses that eligibility information to identify the consumer to receive a solicitation about insurance products, and, as a result, the insurance company provides a solicitation to the consumer about its insurance products. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the insurance company has made a solicitation to the consumer.",
            "(ii) The same facts as in the example in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section, except that after using the eligibility information to identify the consumer to receive a solicitation about insurance products, the insurance company asks the creditor to send the solicitation to the consumer and the creditor does so. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the insurance company has made a solicitation to the consumer because it used eligibility information about the consumer that it received from an affiliate to identify the consumer to receive a solicitation about its products or services, and, as a result, a solicitation was provided to the consumer about the insurance company's products.",
            "(iii) The same facts as in the example in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section, except that eligibility information about consumers that have loan accounts with the creditor is placed into a common database that all members of the affiliated group of companies may independently access and use. Without using the creditor's eligibility information, the insurance company develops selection criteria and provides those criteria, marketing materials, and related instructions to the creditor. The creditor reviews eligibility information about its own consumers using the selection criteria provided by the insurance company to determine which consumers should receive the insurance company's marketing materials and sends marketing materials about the insurance company's products to those consumers. Even though the insurance company has received eligibility information through the common database as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, it did not use that information to identify consumers or establish selection criteria; instead, the creditor used its own eligibility information. Therefore, pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section, the insurance company has not made a solicitation to the consumer.",
            "(iv) The same facts as in the example in paragraph (b)(6)(iii) of this section, except that the creditor provides the insurance company's criteria to the creditor's service provider and directs the service provider to use the creditor's eligibility information to identify creditor consumers who meet the criteria and to send the insurance company's marketing materials to those consumers. The insurance company does not communicate directly with the service provider regarding the use of the creditor's information to market its products to the creditor's consumers. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section, the insurance company has not made a solicitation to the consumer.",
            "(v) An affiliated group of companies includes a creditor, an insurance company, and a service provider. Each affiliate in the group places information about its consumers into a common database. The service provider has access to all information in the common database. The creditor controls access to and use of its eligibility information by the service provider. This control is set forth in a written agreement between the creditor and the service provider. The written agreement also requires the service provider to establish reasonable policies and procedures designed to ensure that the service provider uses the creditor's eligibility information in accordance with specific terms and conditions established by the creditor relating to the marketing of the products and services of all affiliates, including the insurance company. In a separate written communication, the creditor specifies the terms and conditions under which the service provider may use the creditor's eligibility information to market the insurance company's products and services to the creditor's consumers. The specific terms and conditions are: a list of affiliated companies (including the insurance company) whose products or services may be marketed to the creditor's consumers by the service provider; the specific products or types of products that may be marketed to the creditor's consumers by the service provider; the categories of eligibility information that may be used by the service provider in marketing products or services to the creditor's consumers; the types or categories of the creditor's consumers to whom the service provider may market products or services of creditor affiliates; the number and/or types of marketing communications that the service provider may send to the creditor's consumers; and the length of time during which the service provider may market the prod-ucts or services of the creditor's affiliates to its consumers. The creditor periodically evaluates the service provider's compliance with these terms and conditions. The insurance company asks the service provider to market insurance products to certain consumers who have loan accounts with the creditor. Without using the creditor's eligibility information, the insurance company develops selection criteria and provides those criteria, marketing materials, and related instructions to the service provider. The service provider uses the creditor's eligibility information from the common database to identify the creditor's consumers to whom insurance products will be marketed. When the insurance company's marketing materials are provided to the identified consumers, the name of the creditor is displayed on the insurance marketing materials, an introductory letter that accompanies the marketing materials, an account statement that accompanies the marketing materials, or the envelope containing the marketing materials. The re-quirements of paragraph (b)(5) of this section have been satisfied, and the insurance company has not made a solicitation to the consumer.",
            "(vi) The same facts as in the example in paragraph (b)(6)(v) of this section, except that the terms and conditions permit the service provider to use the creditor's eligibility information to market the products and services of other affiliates to the creditor's consumers whenever the service provider deems it appropriate to do so. The service provider uses the creditor's eligibility information in accordance with the discretion af-forded to it by the terms and conditions. Because the terms and conditions are not specific, the requirements of paragraph (b)(5) of this section have not been satisfied.",
            "(c) Exceptions. The provisions of this part do not apply to you if you use eligibility information that you receive from an affiliate:",
            "(1) To make a solicitation for marketing purposes to a consumer with whom you have a pre-existing business relationship;",
            "(2) To facilitate communications to an individual for whose benefit you provide employee benefit or other services pursuant to a contract with an employer related to and arising out of the current employment relationship or status of the individual as a participant or beneficiary of an employee benefit plan;",
            "(3) To perform services on behalf of an affiliate, except that this paragraph shall not be construed as permitting you to send solicitations on behalf of an affiliate if the affiliate would not be permitted to send the solicitation as a result of the election of the consumer to opt out under this part;",
            "(4) In response to a communication about your products or services initiated by the consumer;",
            "(5) In response to an authorization or request by the consumer to receive solicitations; or",
            "(6) If your compliance with this part would prevent you from complying with any provision of State insurance laws pertaining to unfair discrimination in any State in which you are lawfully doing business.",
            "(d) Examples of exceptions\u2014(1) Example of the pre-existing business relationship exception. A consumer has a loan account with a creditor. The consumer also has a relationship with the creditor's securities affiliate for management of the consumer's securities portfolio. The creditor receives eligibility information about the consumer from its securities affiliate and uses that information to make a solicitation to the consumer about the creditor's wealth management services. The creditor may make this solicitation even if the consumer has not been given a notice and opportunity to opt out because the creditor has a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer.",
            "(2) Examples of service provider exception. (i) A consumer has an insurance policy issued by an insurance company. The insurance company furnishes eligibility information about the consumer to an affiliated creditor. Based on that eligibility information, the creditor wants to make a solicitation to the consumer about its credit products. The creditor does not have a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer and none of the other exceptions in para-graph (c) of this section apply. The consumer has been given an opt-out notice and has elected to opt out of receiving such solicitations. The creditor asks a service provider to send the solicitation to the consumer on its behalf. The service provider may not send the solicitation on behalf of the creditor because, as a result of the consumer's opt-out election, the creditor is not permitted to make the solicitation.",
            "(ii) The same facts as in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, except the consumer has been given an opt-out notice, but has not elected to opt out. The creditor asks a service provider to send the solicitation to the consumer on its behalf. The service provider may send the solicitation on behalf of the creditor because, as a result of the consumer's not opting out, the creditor is permitted to make the solicitation.",
            "(3) Examples of consumer-initiated communications. (i) A consumer who has a consumer loan account with a finance company initiates a communication with the creditor's mortgage lending affiliate to request information about a mortgage. The mortgage lender affiliate may use eligibility information about the consumer it obtains from the finance company or any other affiliate to make solicitations regarding mortgage products in response to the consumer-initiated communication.",
            "(ii) A consumer who has a loan account with a creditor contacts the creditor to request information about how to save and invest for a child's college education without specifying the type of product in which the consumer may be interested. Information about a range of different products or services offered by the creditor and one or more affiliates of the creditor may be responsive to that communication. Such products or services may include the following: mutual funds offered by the creditor's mutual fund affil-iate; section 529 plans offered by the creditor, its mutual fund affiliate, or another securities affiliate; or trust services offered by a different creditor in the affiliated group. Any affiliate offering investment products or services that would be responsive to the consumer's request for information about saving and investing for a child's college education may use eligibility information to make solicitations to the consumer in response to this communication.",
            "(iii) A credit card issuer makes a marketing call to the consumer without using eligibility information received from an affiliate. The issuer leaves a voice-mail message that invites the consumer to call a toll-free number to apply for the issuer's credit card. If the consumer calls the toll-free number to inquire about the credit card, the call is a consumer-initiated communication about a product or service and the credit card issuer may now use eligibility information it receives from its affiliates to make solicitations to the consumer.",
            "(iv) A consumer calls a creditor to ask about retail locations and hours, but does not request information about products or services. The creditor may not use eligibility information it receives from an affiliate to make solicitations to the consumer about its products or services because the consumer-initiated communication does not relate to the creditor's products or services. Thus, the use of eligibility information received from an affiliate would not be responsive to the communication and the exception does not apply.",
            "(v) A consumer calls a creditor to ask about office locations and hours. The customer service representative asks the consumer if there is a particular product or service about which the consumer is seeking information. The consumer responds that the consumer wants to stop in and find out about second mortgage loans. The customer service representative offers to provide that information by telephone and mail additional information and application materials to the consumer. The consumer agrees and provides or confirms contact information for receipt of the materials to be mailed. The creditor may use eligibility information it receives from an affiliate to make solicitations to the consumer about mortgage loan products because such solicitations respond to the consumer-initiated communication about products or services.",
            "(4) Examples of consumer authorization or request for solicitations. (i) A consumer who obtains a mortgage from a mortgage lender authorizes or requests information about homeowner's insurance offered by the mortgage lender's insurance affiliate. Such authorization or request, whether given to the mortgage lender or to the insurance affiliate, would permit the insurance affiliate to use eligibility information about the consumer it obtains from the mortgage lender or any other affiliate to make solicitations to the consumer about homeowner's insurance.",
            "(ii) A consumer completes an online application to apply for a credit card from a department store. The store's online application contains a blank check box that the consumer may check to authorize or request information from the store's affiliates. The consumer checks the box. The consumer has authorized or requested solicitations from store's affiliates.",
            "(iii) A consumer completes an online application to apply for a credit card from a department store. The store's online application contains a pre-selected check box indicating that the consumer authorizes or requests information from the store's affiliates. The consumer does not deselect the check box. The consumer has not authorized or requested solicitations from the store's affiliates.",
            "(iv) The terms and conditions of a credit account agreement contain preprinted boilerplate language stating that by applying to open an account the consumer authorizes or requests to receive solicitations from the creditor's affiliates. The consumer has not authorized or requested solicitations from the creditor's affiliates.",
            "(e) Relation to affiliate-sharing notice and opt-out. Nothing in this part limits the responsibility of a person to comply with the notice and opt-out provisions of section 603(d)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act where applicable."

If there is no continuing relationship between a consumer and you or your affiliate, and you or your affiliate obtain eligibility information about a consumer in connection with a transaction with the consumer, such as an isolated transaction or a credit application that is denied, an opt-out notice provided to the consumer only applies to eligibility information obtained in connection with that transaction.",

However, one of the alternatives must allow the consumer to prohibit all solicitations from all of the affiliates that are covered by the notice.",
            "(5) Special rule for a notice following termination of all continuing relationships\u2014(i) In general. A consumer must be given a new opt-out notice if, after all continuing relationships with you or your affiliate(s) are terminated, the consumer subsequently establishes another continuing relationship with you or your affiliate(s) and the consumer's eligibility information is to be used to make a solicitation. The new opt-out notice must apply, at a minimum, to eligibility information obtained in connection with the new continuing relationship. Consistent with paragraph (b) of this section, the consumer's decision not to opt out after receiving the new opt-out notice would not override a prior opt-out election by the consumer that applies to eligibility information obtained in connection with a terminated relationship, regardless of whether the new opt-out notice applies to eligibility information obtained in connection with the terminated relationship.",
            "(ii) Example. A consumer has an automobile loan account with a creditor that is part of an affiliated group. The consumer pays off the loan. After paying off the loan, the consumer subsequently obtains a second mortgage loan from the creditor. The consumer must be given a new notice and opportunity to opt out before the creditor's affiliates may make solicitations to the consumer using eligibility information obtained by the creditor in connection with the new mortgage relationship, regardless of whether the consumer opted out in connection with the automobile loan account.",
            "(b) Duration of opt-out. The election of a consumer to opt out must be effective for a period of at least five years (the \u201copt-out period\u201d) beginning when the consumer's opt-out election is received and implemented, unless the consumer subsequently revokes the opt-out in writing or, if the consumer agrees, electronically. An opt-out period of more than five years may be established, including an opt-out period that does not expire unless revoked by the consumer.",
            "(c) Time of opt-out. A consumer may opt out at any time."

            "(a) The Act applies to written warranties on tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes. This definition includes property which is intended to be attached to or installed in any real property without regard to whether it is so attached or installed. This means that a product is a \u201cconsumer product\u201d if the use of that type of product is not uncommon. The percentage of sales or the use to which a product is put by any individual buyer is not determinative. For example, products such as automobiles and typewriters which are used for both personal and commercial purposes come within the definition of consumer product. Where it is unclear whether a particular product is covered under the definition of consumer product, any ambiguity will be resolved in favor of coverage.",
            "(b) Agricultural products such as farm machinery, structures and implements used in the business or occupation of farming are not covered by the Act where their personal, family, or household use is uncommon. However, those agricultural products normally used for personal or household gardening (for example, to produce goods for personal consumption, and not for resale) are consumer products under the Act.",
            "(c) The definition of \u201cConsumer product\u201d limits the applicability of the Act to personal property, \u201cincluding any such property intended to be attached to or installed in any real property without regard to whether it is so attached or installed.\u201d This provision brings under the Act separate items of equipment attached to real property, such as air conditioners, furnaces, and water heaters.",
            "(d) The coverage of separate items of equipment attached to real property includes, but is not limited to, appliances and other thermal, mechanical, and electrical equipment. (It does not extend to the wiring, plumbing, ducts, and other items which are integral component parts of the structure.) State law would classify many such products as fixtures to, and therefore a part of, realty. The statutory definition is designed to bring such products under the Act regardless of whether they may be considered fixtures under state law.",
            "(e) The coverage of building materials which are not separate items of equipment is based on the nature of the purchase transaction. An analysis of the transaction will determine whether the goods are real or personal property. The numerous products which go into the construction of a consumer dwelling are all consumer products when sold \u201cover the counter,\u201d as by hardware and building supply retailers. This is also true where a consumer contracts for the purchase of such materials in connection with the improvement, repair, or modification of a home (for example, paneling, dropped ceilings, siding, roofing, storm windows, remodeling). However, where such products are at the time of sale integrated into the structure of a dwelling they are not consumer products as they cannot be practically distinguished from realty. Thus, for example, the beams, wallboard, wiring, plumbing, windows, roofing, and other structural components of a dwelling are not consumer products when they are sold as part of real estate covered by a written warranty.",
            "(f) In the case where a consumer contracts with a builder to construct a home, a substantial addition to a home, or other realty (such as a garage or an in-ground swimming pool) the building materials to be used are not consumer products. Although the materials are separately identifiable at the time the contract is made, it is the intention of the parties to contract for the construction of realty which will integrate the component materials. Of course, as noted above, any separate items of equipment to be attached to such realty are consumer products under the Act.",
            "(g) Certain provisions of the Act apply only to products actually costing the consumer more than a specified amount. Section 103, 15 U.S.C. 2303, applies to consumer products actually costing the consumer more than $10, excluding tax. The $10 minimum will be interpreted to include multiple-packaged items which may individually sell for less than $10, but which have been packaged in a manner that does not permit breaking the package to purchase an item or items at a price less than $10. Thus, a written warranty on a dozen items packaged and priced for sale at $12 must be designated, even though identical items may be offered in smaller quantities at under $10. This interpretation applies in the same manner to the minimum dollar limits in section 102, 15 U.S.C. 2302, and rules promulgated under that section.",
            "(h) Warranties on replacement parts and components used to repair consumer products are covered; warranties on services are not covered. Therefore, warranties which apply solely to a repairer's workmanship in performing repairs are not subject to the Act. Where a written agreement warrants both the parts provided to effect a repair and the workmanship in making that repair, the warranty must comply with the Act and the rules thereunder.",
            "(i) The Act covers written warranties on consumer products \u201cdistributed in commerce\u201d as that term is defined in section 101(13), 15 U.S.C. 2301(13). Thus, by its terms the Act arguably applies to products exported to foreign jurisdictions. However, the public interest would not be served by the use of Commission resources to enforce the Act with respect to such products. Moreover, the legislative intent to apply the requirements of the Act to such products is not sufficiently clear to justify such an extraordinary result. The Commission does not contemplate the enforcement of the Act with respect to consumer products exported to foreign jurisdictions. Products exported for sale at military post exchanges remain subject to the same enforcement standards as products sold within the United States, its territories and possessions."

            "(a) The Act imposes specific duties and liabilities on suppliers who offer written warranties on consumer products. Certain representations, such as energy efficiency ratings for electrical appliances, care labeling of wearing apparel, and other product information disclosures may be express warranties under the Uniform Commercial Code. However, these disclosures alone are not written warranties under this Act. Section 101(6), 15 U.S.C. 2301(6), provides that a written affirmation of fact or a written promise of a specified level of performance must relate to a specified period of time in order to be considered a \u201cwritten warranty.\u201d \n1\n A product information disclosure without a specified time period to which the disclosure relates is therefore not a written warranty. In addition, section 111(d), 15 U.S.C. 2311(d), exempts from the Act (except section 102(c), 15 U.S.C. 2302(c)) any written warranty the making or content of which is required by federal law. The Commission encourages the disclosure of product information which is not deceptive and which may benefit consumers, and will not construe the Act to impede information disclosure in product advertising or labeling.",
            "(b) Certain terms, or conditions, of sale of a consumer product may not be \u201cwritten warranties\u201d as that term is defined in section 101(6), 15 U.S.C. 2301(6), and should not be offered or described in a manner that may deceive consumers as to their enforceability under the Act. For example, a seller of consumer products may give consumers an unconditional right to revoke acceptance of goods within a certain number of days after delivery without regard to defects or failure to meet a specified level of performance. Or a seller may permit consumers to return products for any reason for credit toward purchase of another item. Such terms of sale taken alone are not written warranties under the Act. Therefore, suppliers should avoid any characterization of such terms of sale as warranties. The use of such terms as \u201cfree trial period\u201d and \u201ctrade-in credit policy\u201d in this regard would be appropriate. Furthermore, such terms of sale should be stated separately from any written warranty. Of course, the offering and performance of such terms of sale remain subject to section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. 45.",
            "(c) The Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act generally applies to written warranties covering consumer products. Many consumer products are covered by warranties which are neither intended for, nor enforceable by, consumers. A common example is a warranty given by a component supplier to a manufacturer of consumer products. (The manufacturer may, in turn, warrant these components to consumers.) The component supplier's warranty is generally given solely to the product manufacturer, and is neither intended to be conveyed to the consumer nor brought to the consumer's attention in connection with the sale. Such warranties are not subject to the Act, since a written warranty under section 101(6) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 2301(6), must become \u201cpart of the basis of the bargain between a supplier and a buyer for purposes other than resale.\u201d However, the Act applies to a component supplier's warranty in writing which is given to the consumer. An example is a supplier's written warranty to the consumer covering a refrigerator that is sold installed in a boat or recreational vehicle. The supplier of the refrigerator relies on the boat or vehicle assembler to convey the written agreement to the consumer. In this case, the supplier's written warranty is to a consumer, and is covered by the Act."

In addition, to qualify for an exemption under section 103(b), 15 U.S.C. 2303(b), such policies may not be subject to any specific limitations. For example, policies which have an express limitation of duration or a limitation of the amount to be refunded are not exempted. This does not preclude the imposition of reasonable limitations based on the circumstances in each instance a consumer seeks to invoke such an agreement. For instance, a warrantor may refuse to honor such an expression of policy where a consumer has used a product for 10 years without previously expressing any dissatisfaction with the product. Such a refusal would not be a specific limitation under this provision."

Warrantors may include a statement of duration in a limited warranty designation. The designation or designations should appear clearly and conspicuously as a caption, or prominent title, clearly separated from the text of the warranty. The full (statement of duration) warranty and limited warranty are the exclusive designations permitted under the Act, unless a specific exception is created by rule.",
            "(b) Based on section 104(b)(4), 15 U.S.C. 2304(b)(4), the duties under subsection (a) of section 104, 15 U.S.C. 2304, extend from the warrantor to each person who is a consumer with respect to the consumer product. Section 101(3), 15 U.S.C. 2301(3), defines a consumer as a buyer (other than for purposes of resale) of any consumer product, any person to whom such product is transferred during the duration of an implied or written warranty (or service contract) applicable to the product. Therefore, a full warranty may not expressly restrict the warranty rights of a transferee during its stated duration. However, where the duration of a full warranty is defined solely in terms of first purchaser ownership there can be no violation of section 104(b)(4), 15 U.S.C. 2304(b)(4), since the duration of the warranty expires, by definition, at the time of transfer. No rights of a subsequent transferee are cut off as there is no transfer of ownership \u201cduring the duration of (any) warranty.\u201d Thus, these provisions do not preclude the offering of a full warranty with its duration determined exclusively by the period during which the first purchaser owns the product, or uses it in conjunction with another product. For example, an automotive battery or muffler warranty may be designated as \u201cfull warranty for as long as you own your car.\u201d Because this type of warranty leads the consumer to believe that proof of purchase is not needed so long as he or she owns the product a duty to furnish documentary proof may not be reasonably imposed on the consumer under this type of warranty. The burden is on the warrantor to prove that a particular claimant under this type of warranty is not the original purchaser or owner of the product. Warrantors or their designated agents may, however, ask consumers to state or affirm that they are the first purchaser of the product."

Warrantors have in the past stipulated the return of a \u201cwarranty registration\u201d or similar card. By \u201cwarranty registration card\u201d the Commission means a card which must be returned by the consumer shortly after purchase of the product and which is stipulated or implied in the warranty to be a condition precedent to warranty coverage and performance.",
            "(b) A requirement that the consumer return a warranty registration card or a similar notice as a condition of performance under a full warranty is an unreasonable duty. Thus, a provision such as, \u201cThis warranty is void unless the warranty registration card is returned to the warrantor\u201d is not permissible in a full warranty, nor is it permissible to imply such a condition in a full warranty.",
            "(c) This does not prohibit the use of such registration cards where a warrantor suggests use of the card as one possible means of proof of the date the product was purchased. For example, it is permissible to provide in a full warranty that a consumer may fill out and return a card to place on file proof of the date the product was purchased. Any such suggestion to the consumer must include notice that failure to return the card will not affect rights under the warranty, so long as the consumer can show in a reasonable manner the date the product was purchased. Nor does this interpretation prohibit a seller from obtaining from purchasers at the time of sale information requested by the warrantor."

If the warranted product has utility only when installed, a full warranty must provide such installation without charge regardless of whether or not the consumer originally paid for installation by the warrantor or his agent. However, this does not preclude the warrantor from imposing on the consumer a duty to remove, return, or reinstall where such duty can be demonstrated by the warrantor to meet the standard of reasonableness under section 104(b)(1), 15 U.S.C. 2304(b)(1)."

            "(b) Under a limited warranty that provides only for replacement of defective parts and no portion of labor charges, section 102(c), 15 U.S.C. 2302(c), prohibits a condition that the consumer use only service (labor) identified by the warrantor to install the replacement parts. A warrantor or his designated representative may not provide parts under the warranty in a manner which impedes or precludes the choice by the consumer of the person or business to perform necessary labor to install such parts.",
            "(c) No warrantor may condition the continued validity of a warranty on the use of only authorized repair service and/or authorized replacement parts for non-warranty service and maintenance (other than an article of service provided without charge under the warranty or unless the warrantor has obtained a waiver pursuant to section 102(c) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 2302(c)). For example, provisions such as, \u201cThis warranty is void if service is performed by anyone other than an authorized `ABC' dealer and all replacement parts must be genuine `ABC' parts,\u201d and the like, are prohibited where the service or parts are not covered by the warranty. These provisions violate the Act in two ways. First, they violate the section 102(c), 15 U.S.C. 2302(c), ban against tying arrangements. Second, such provisions are deceptive under section 110 of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 2310, because a warrantor cannot, as a matter of law, avoid liability under a written warranty where a defect is unrelated to the use by a consumer of \u201cunauthorized\u201d articles or service. In addition, warranty language that implies to a consumer acting reasonably in the circumstances that warranty coverage requires the consumer's purchase of an article or service identified by brand, trade or corporate name is similarly deceptive. For example, a provision in the warranty such as, \u201cuse only an authorized `ABC' dealer\u201d or \u201cuse only `ABC' replacement parts,\u201d is prohibited where the service or parts are not provided free of charge pursuant to the warranty. This does not preclude a warrantor from expressly excluding liability for defects or damage caused by \u201cunauthorized\u201d articles or service; nor does it preclude the warrantor from denying liability where the warrantor can demonstrate that the defect or damage was so caused."

            "(a) The Act recognizes two types of agreements which may provide similar coverage of consumer products, the written warranty, and the service contract. In addition, other agreements may meet the statutory definitions of either \u201cwritten warranty\u201d or \u201cservice contract,\u201d but are sold and regulated under state law as contracts of insurance. One example is the automobile breakdown insurance policies sold in many jurisdictions and regulated by the state as a form of casualty insurance. The McCarran-Ferguson Act, 15 U.S.C. 1011 et seq., provides that most federal laws (including the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act) shall not be construed to invalidate, impair, or supersede any law enacted by any State for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance. While three specific laws are subject to a separate proviso, the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act is not one of them. Thus, to the extent the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act's service contract provisions apply to the business of insurance, they are effective so long as they do not invalidate, impair, or supersede a State law enacted for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance.",
            "(b) \u201cWritten warranty\u201d and \u201cservice contract\u201d are defined in sections 101(6) and 101(8) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 2301(6) and 15 U.S.C. 2301(8), respectively. This means that it must be conveyed at the time of sale of the consumer product and the consumer must not give any consideration beyond the purchase price of the consumer product in order to benefit from the agreement. It is not a requirement of the Act that an agreement obligate a supplier of the consumer product to a written warranty, but merely that it be part of the basis of the bargain between a supplier and a consumer. This contemplates written warranties by third-party non-suppliers.",
            "(c) A service contract under the Act must meet the definitions of section 101(8), 15 U.S.C. 2301(8). An agreement which would meet the definition of written warranty in section 101(6)(A) or (B), 15 U.S.C. 2301(6)(A) or (B), but for its failure to satisfy the basis of the bargain test is a service contract. For example, an agreement which calls for some consideration in addition to the purchase price of the consumer product, or which is entered into at some date after the purchase of the consumer product to which it applies, is a service contract. An agreement which relates only to the performance of maintenance and/or inspection services and which is not an undertaking, promise, or affirmation with respect to a specified level of performance, or that the product is free of defects in materials or workmanship, is a service contract. An agreement to perform periodic cleaning and inspection of a product over a specified period of time, even when offered at the time of sale and without charge to the consumer, is an example of such a service contract."

All commercially significant rights are transferred even if the patent holder retains limited manufacturing rights, as defined in \u00a7 801.1(p), or co-rights, as defined in \u00a7 801.1(q).",
            "Examples: Although these examples refer to licenses, which are typically used to effect the transfer of pharmaceutical patent rights to a recipient of those rights, other methods of transferring patent rights, by assignment or grant, among others, are similarly covered by these rules and examples.",
            "1. B holds a patent relating to an active pharmaceutical ingredient for cardiovascular use. A will obtain a license from B that grants A the exclusive right to all of B's patent rights except that both A and B can manufacture the active pharmaceutical ingredient to be sold by A under the exclusive license agreement. B retains limited manufacturing rights as defined in \u00a7 801.1(p) because it retains the right to manufacture the product covered by the patent for cardiovascular use solely to provide the product to A. A is still receiving all commercially significant rights to the patent, and the transfer of these rights via the license constitutes an asset acquisition. Further, even if B retained all rights to manufacture (so that A could not manufacture), B would still retain limited manufacturing rights, and A would still receive all commercially significant rights to the patent. Thus, the transfer of these rights via the license would also constitute an asset acquisition.",
            "2. B holds a patent for an in-vitro diagnostic substance relating to arthritis. B will grant A an exclusive license to all of B's patent rights for all veterinary indications. B retains all patent rights for all human indications. The exclusive license to all commercially significant rights for all veterinary indications is an asset acquisition because A is receiving all rights to the patent for a therapeutic area.",
            "3. B holds a patent relating to a biological product. B will grant A an exclusive license to all of B's patent rights in all therapeutic areas. A and B are also entering into a co-development and co-commercialization agreement under which B will assist A in developing, marketing and promoting the product to physicians. B cannot separately use the patent in the same therapeutic area as A under the co-development and co-commercialization agreement. A will book all sales of the product and will pay B a portion of the profits resulting from those sales. Despite B's retention of these co-rights, A is still receiving all commercially significant rights. The licensing agreement is an asset acquisition. This would be an asset acquisition even if B also retained limited manufacturing rights.",
            "4. B holds a patent relating to an active pharmaceutical ingredient and a bulk compound that contains that active pharmaceutical ingredient. B will grant A an exclusive license to use the bulk compound to manufacture and sell a finished product in the neurological therapeutic area. B cannot manufacture the active pharmaceutical ingredient or bulk compound for any other finished products in the neurological area, but it can manufacture either for use by another party in a different therapeutic area. Despite B's retention of manufacturing rights of the active pharmaceutical ingredient and bulk compound for therapeutic areas other than neurology, A is still receiving all commercially significant rights in a therapeutic area and the licensing agreement is the acquisition of an asset.",
            "5. B holds a patent related to a pharmaceutical product that has been approved by the FDA. B will enter into an exclusive distribution agreement with A that will give A the right to distribute the product in the U.S. B will manufacture the product for A and will receive a portion of all revenues from the sale of the product. A receives no exclusive patent rights under the distribution agreement. A has not obtained all commercially significant rights to the patent because it is only handling the logistics of selling and distributing the product on B's behalf. Therefore, the exclusive distribution agreement is not an asset acquisition."

            "(4) In April 2024, \u201cA\u201d signs a contract with a stated purchase price of $174 million, subject to adjustments, to acquire all of the assets of \u201cB.\u201d If the amount of adjustments can be reasonably estimated, the acquisition price\u2014as adjusted to reflect that estimate\u2014is determined. If the amount of adjustments cannot be reasonably estimated, the acquisition price is undetermined. In either case the board or its delegee must also determine in good faith the fair market value. (\u00a7 801.10(b) of this chapter states that the value of an asset acquisition is to be the fair market value or the acquisition price, if determined and greater than fair market value.) \u201cA\u201d files notification and submits a $30,000 (as adjusted) filing fee. \u201cA's\u201d decision to pay that fee may be justified on either of two bases. First, \u201cA\u201d may have concluded that the acquisition price can be reasonably estimated to be less than $173.3 million, because of anticipated adjustments\u2014e.g., based on due diligence by \u201cA's\u201d accounting firm indicating that one third of the inventory is not saleable. If fair market value is also determined in good faith to be less than $173.3 million, the $30,000 (as adjusted) fee is appropriate. Alternatively, \u201cA\u201d may conclude that because the adjustments cannot reasonably be estimated, the acquisition price is undetermined. If so, \u201cA\u201d would base the valuation on the good faith determination of fair market value. The acquiring party's execution of the Certification also attests to the good faith valuation of the value of the transaction.",
            "(5) In April 2024, \u201cA\u201d contracts to acquire all of the assets of \u201cB\u201d for $550 million. The assets include hotels, office buildings, and rental retail property, all of which are exempted by \u00a7 802.2 of this chapter. Section 802.2 directs that these assets\u2014which are valued at $300 million\u2014are exempt from the requirements of the act and that reporting requirements for the transaction should be determined by analyzing the remainder of the acquisition as if it were a separate transaction. Furthermore, \u00a7 801.15(a)(2) of this chapter states that those exempt assets are never held as a result of the acquisition. Accordingly, the aggregate amount of the transaction is in excess of $161.5 million (as adjusted), but less than $500 million (as adjusted). \u201cA\u201d will be liable for a filing fee of $100,000 (as adjusted), rather than $250,000 (as adjusted), because the value of the transaction is not less than $161.5 million (adjusted) but is less than $500 million (as adjusted).",
            "(6) In April 2024, \u201cA\u201d acquires coal reserves from \u201cB\u201d valued at $150 million. No notification or filing fee is required because the acquisition is exempted by \u00a7 802.3(b) of this chapter. Three months later, A proposes to acquire additional coal reserves from \u201cB\u201d valued at $500 million. This transaction is subject to the notification requirements of the act because the value of the acquisition exceeds the $200 million limitation on the exemption in \u00a7 802.3(b). As a result of \u00a7 801.13(b)(2)(ii) of this chapter, the prior $150 million acquisition must be added because the additional $500 million of coal reserves were acquired from the same person within 180 days of the initial acquisition. Because aggregating the two acquisitions exceeds the $200 million exemption limitation, \u00a7 801.15(b) of this chapter directs that \u201cA\u201d will also hold the previously exempt $150 million acquisition; thus, the aggregate amount held as a result of the $500 million acquisition is $650 million. Accordingly, \u201cA\u201d must file notification to acquire the coal reserves valued in excess of $500 million (as adjusted) but less than $1 billion (as adjusted) and pay a filing fee of $250,000 (as adjusted).",
            "(7) In April 2024, \u201cA\u201d intends to acquire 20 percent of the voting securities of B, a non-publicly traded issuer. The agreed upon acquisition price is $172.3 million subject to post-closing adjustments of up to plus or minus $2 million. \u201cA\u201d estimates that the adjustments will be minus $1 million. In this example, since \u201cA\u201d is able in good faith to reasonably estimate the adjustments to the agreed-on price, the acquisition price is deemed to be determined and the appropriate filing fee threshold is $50 million (as adjusted). Even if the post-closing adjustments cause the final price actually paid to exceed $172.3 million, \u201cA\u201d would be deemed to hold $171.3 million in B voting securities as a result of this acquisition. Note, that any additional acquisition by \u201cA\u201d of B voting may trigger another filing and require the appropriate fee.",
            "(8) In April 2024, \u201cA\u201d intends to make a cash tender offer for a minimum of 50 percent plus one share of the voting securities of B, a non-publicly traded issuer, but will accept up to 100 percent of the shares if they are tendered. There are 12 million shares of B voting stock outstanding and the tender offer price is $100 per share. In this instance, since there is no cap on the number of shares that can be tendered, the value of the transaction will be the value of 100 percent of B's voting securities, and \u201cA\u201d must pay the $400,000 (as adjusted) fee for the $1 billion (as adjusted) filing fee threshold. Note that if the tender offer had been for a maximum of 50 percent plus one share the value of the transaction would be $600 million, and the appropriate fee would be $250,000 (as adjusted), based on the $500 million (as adjusted) filing fee threshold. This would be true even if the tender offer were to be followed by a merger which would be exempt under section 7A(c)(3) of the act.",
            "(b) For a transaction described by \u00a7 801.2(d)(2)(iii), the parties shall pay only one filing fee. In accordance with \u00a7 801.2(d)(2)(iii), both parties to a consolidation are acquiring and acquired persons and must submit a Notification and Report Form where the transaction meets the reporting requirements of that act; however, only one filing fee is required in connection with such a transaction, and is payable by either party to the transaction. The filing fee is based on the greater of the two sizes of transaction in the consolidation.",
            "(c) For a reportable transaction in which the acquiring entity has two ultimate parent entities, both ultimate parent entities are acquiring persons; however, if the responses for both ultimate parent entities would be the same for the NAICS Codes section of the Notification and Report Form, only one filing fee is required in connection with the transaction.",
            "(d) Manner of payment. Fees may be paid by United States postal money order, bank money order, bank cashier's check, certified check or by electronic wire transfer (EWT). The fee must be paid in U.S. currency.",
            "(1) Fees paid by money order or check shall be made payable to the \u201cFederal Trade Commission,\u201d omitting the name or title of any official of the Commission, and shall be submitted to the Premerger Notification Office of the Federal Trade Commission along with the Notification and Report Form.",
            "(2) Fees paid by EWT shall be deposited to the Treasury's account at the New York Federal Reserve Bank. Specific instructions for making EWT payments are contained in the Instructions to the Notification and Report Form.",
            "(e) Refunds. Except as provided in this paragraph, no filing fee received by the Commission will be returned to the payer and no part of the filing fee shall be refunded. The filing fee shall be refunded only if the Commission's staff determines, based on the information and representations contained in the filing person's notification, that premerger notification was not required by the act. Once the Commission's staff has determined that the notification was required, the filing fee shall not be refunded even if it appears at the time of consummation that the transaction does not meet the reporting requirements established in the act.",
            "(f) For a transaction described by paragraph (c) of \u00a7 803.12, the parties shall pay no additional filing fee."

          "heading": "\u00a7 1009.3   Policy on imported products, importers, and foreign manufacturers.",
          "paragraphs": [
            "(a) This policy states the Commission's views as to imported products subject to the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2051) and the other Acts the Commission administers: The Federal Hazardous Substances Act (15 U.S.C. 1261), the Flammable Fabrics Act (15 U.S.C. 1191), the Poison Prevention Packaging Act (15 U.S.C. 1471), and the Refrigerator Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1211). Basically, the Policy states that in order to fully protect the American consumer from hazardous consumer products the Commission will seek to ensure that importers and foreign manufacturers, as well as domestic manufacturers, distributors, and retailers, carry out their obligations and responsibilities under the five Acts. The Commission will also seek to establish, to the maximum extent possible, uniform import procedures for products subject to the Acts the Commission administers.",
            "(b) The Consumer Product Safety Act recognizes the critical position of importers in protecting American consumers from unreasonably hazardous products made abroad and accordingly, under that Act, importers are made subject to the same responsibilities as domestic manufacturers. This is explicitly stated in the definition of \u201cmanufacturer\u201d as any person who manufacturers or imports a consumer product (Section 3(a)(4); 15 U.S.C. 2052(a)(4)).",
            "(c) The Federal Hazardous Substances Act (15 U.S.C. 1261 et seq.), the Flammable Fabrics Act (15 U.S.C. 1191 et seq.), the Poison Prevention Packaging Act (15 U.S.C. 1471 et seq.), which were transferred to the jurisdiction of the Consumer Product Safety Commission under its enabling act, all assign responsibilities to importers comparable to those of manufacturers and distributors.",
            "(d) Historically, foreign-made products entering the United States were \u201ccleared\u201d by those agencies with particular jurisdiction over them. Products so cleared were limited in number relative to total imports. The Consumer Product Safety Commission has jurisdiction over a far larger number of products entering the United States through over 300 ports of entry. In addition, the total number of imports has dramatically increased over the years and modern technology has brought air transport and containerized freight for rapid handling and distribution of consumer and other products. For the Commission to effectively \u201cclear\u201d such products through ports of entry could seriously impede and delay the transport of consumer products and impose additional costs to both the consumer and the importer.",
            "(e) The Consumer Product Safety Act provides alternative means to both assure the consumer safe products and facilitate the free movement of consumer products in commerce. For example, it requires certification by manufacturers (foreign and domestic), importers and private labelers of products that are subject to a consumer product safety standard. Such certification must be based on a test of each product or upon a reasonable testing program. The other acts enforced by the Commission do not specifically require certificates; however, both the Flammable Fabrics Act and the Federal Hazardous Substances Act encourage guarantees of compliance by protecting from criminal prosecution persons who have in good faith received such guarantees (15 U.S.C. 1197(a); 16 CFR 302.11; 15 U.S.C. 1264(b)).",
            "(f) In the interest of giving the American consumer the full measure of protection from hazardous products anticipated by the Congress, it is the Commission's policy to assure that importers and foreign manufacturers carry out their responsibilities under all laws administered by this Commission. Specifically:",
            "(1) Importers have responsibilities and obligations comparable to those of domestic manufacturers. Rules and regulations promulgated by the Commission will reflect these responsibilities and obligations.",
            "(2) In promulgating its rules and regulations, the Commission encourages the participation and comments of the import community, including importers and foreign manufacturers.",
            "(3) All imported products under the jurisdiction of the Consumer Product Safety Commission shall, to the maximum extent possible, be subject to uniform import procedures. The Commission recognizes the need to establish and implement procedures that minimize delay and expense involved in inspecting cargo at a port of entry. The Commission encourages cooperation between importers, foreign manufacturers and foreign governments, which increases the safety of the consumer and facilitates the free movement of goods between countries.",
            "(4) When enforcement actions are appropriate, they will be directed toward the responsible officials of any import organization and will not be restricted to action solely against the product.",
            "(5) Legal actions sought by the Commission will usually be primarily directed toward the owner or consignee of imported goods rather than against the customs broker even though his or her name may appear as the importer of record. However, the Commissioner believes it will not serve the public interest to impede the Commission's rights of investigation and enforcement by exempting a customs broker from the coverage of the law merely because of his or her title or usual form of business. It may be relevant that a customs broker, who does not have an ownership interest in the goods but who is acting as an agent for the actual owner or consignee, signs the entry documents as importer of record. What effect and possible need for inclusion this will have in a particular case can be judged by the Commission on a case-by-case basis.",
            "(6) Commission procedures on imports shall be developed in the context of the overall responsibilities, authorities, priorities, resources, and compliance philosophy of this Commission. Any existing procedures which have been inherited from predecessor agencies will be reviewed and revised, if necessary, to be consistent with the authority and philosophy of this Commission.",
            "(g) The Commission recognizes that the importer may not be the only person to be held responsible for protecting American Consumers from unreasonably hazardous products made abroad, but the importer is, at least, in a strategic position to guarantee the safety of imported products.",
            "(h) Whenever, in the application of this policy, it appears that barriers to free trade may arise, the Commission may consider exceptions to this policy insofar as it can be done without compromising the Commission's responsibilities to assure safe products to the consumer.",
            "(i) Whenever, in the application of this policy, it appears that administrative or procedural aspects of the Commission's regulations are unduly burdening the free flow of goods, the Commission may consider modifications which alleviate such burdens. However, the Commission cannot consider any modifications which do not assure the consumer the same protection from unsafe foreign goods as from unsafe domestic goods."

            "(a) This document states the Consumer Product Safety Commission's policy on establishing priorities for action under the five acts the Commission administers. The policy is issued pursuant to sections 4(f)(2) and 4(f)(3) of the Consumer Product Safety Act, as amended, and in further implementation of the Commission's statement of policy dated September 21, 1973.",
            "(b) It is the general policy of the Commission that priorities for Commission action will be established by a majority vote of its members. The policy will be reflected by votes on all requests for appropriations, an annual operating plan, and any revisions thereof. Recognizing that these documents are the result of a lengthy planning process, during which many decisions are made that substantially determine the content of the final documents, the Chairman shall continually keep the Commission apprised of, and seek its guidance concerning, significant problems, policy questions and alternative solutions throughout the planning cycle leading to the development of budget requests and operating plans.",
            "(1) Requests for appropriations. Requests for appropriations are submitted concurrently to the President or the Office of Management and Budget and to the Congress pursuant to section 27(k)(1) of the Consumer Product Safety Act.",
            "(2) Annual operating plan. The operating plan shall be as specific as possible with regard to products, groups of products, or generic hazards to be addressed. It shall be submitted to the Commission for approval at least 30 days prior to the beginning of the fiscal year.",
            "(c) In establishing and revising its priorities, the Commission will endeavor to fulfill each of its purposes as set forth in section 2(b) of the Consumer Product Safety Act. In so doing, it will apply the following general criteria:",
            "(1) Frequency and severity of injuries. Two major criteria in determining priorities are the frequency and severity of injuries associated with consumer products. All available data including the NEISS hazard index and supplementary data collection systems, such as fire surveys and death certificate collection, shall be used to attempt to identify the frequency and severity of injuries. Consideration shall also be given to areas known to be undercounted by NEISS and a judgment reached as to the probable frequency and severity of injuries in such areas. The judgment as to severity shall include an evaluation of the seriousness of the injury.",
            "(2) Causality of injuries. Consideration shall then be given to the amenability of a product hazard to injury reduction through standard setting, information and education, or other Commission action. This step involves an analysis of the extent to which the product and other factors such as consumer behavior are causally related to the injury pattern. Priority shall be assigned to products according to the extent of product causality involvement and the extent of injuries that can reasonably be expected to be reduced or eliminated through commission action.",
            "(3) Chronic illness and future injuries. Certain products, although not presently associated with large numbers of frequent or severe injuries, deserve priority attention if there is reason to believe that the products will in the future be associated with many such injuries. Although not as susceptible to measurements as other product related injuries and illnesses, these risks shall be evaluated on the basis of the best information available and given priority on the basis of the predicted future illnesses and injuries and the effectiveness of Commission action in reducing or eliminating them.",
            "(4) Cost and benefit of CPSC action. Consideration shall be given on a preliminary basis to the prospective cost of Commission action to consumers and producers, and to the benefits expected to accrue to society from the resulting reduction of injuries. Consideration of product cost increases will be supplemented to the extent feasible and necessary by assessments of effects on utility or convenience of the product; product sales and shifts to substitutes; and industry supply factors, competitive structure, or employment. While all these facets of potential social \u201ccost\u201d cannot be subsumed in a single, quantitative cost measure, they will be weighed, to the extent they are available, against injury reduction benefits. The benefit estimates will be based on (i) explicitly stated expectations as to the effectiveness of regulatory options (derived from criterion (2), \u201ccausality of injuries\u201d); (ii) costs of injuries and deaths based on the latest injury cost data and analyses available to the Commission; (iii) explicit estimates or assumptions as to average product lives; and (iv) such other factors as may be relevant in particular cases. The Commission recognizes that in analyzing benefits as well as costs there will frequently be modifying factors\u2014e.g., criteria (5) and (6)\u2014or analytical uncertainties that complicate matters and militate against reliance on single numerical expressions. Hence the Commission cannot commit itself to priorities based solely on the preliminary cost/benefit comparisons that will be available at the stage of priority setting, nor to any one form of comparison such as net benefits or cost-benefit ratios. Commission costs will also be considered. The Commission has a responsibility to insure that its resources are utilized efficiently. Assuming other factors to be equal, a higher priority will be assigned to those products which can be addressed using fewer Commission resources.",
            "(5) Unforeseen nature of the risk. Other things being equal, consideration should be to the degree of consumer awareness both of the hazard and of its consequences. Priority could then be given to unforeseen and unforeseeable risks arising from the ordinary use of a product.",
            "(6) Vulnerability of the population at risk. Children, the elderly, and the handicapped are often less able to judge or escape certain dangers in a consumer product or in the home environment. Because these consumers are, therefore, more vulnerable to danger in products designed for their special use or frequently used by them, the Commission will usually place a higher priority, assuming other factors are equal, on preventing product related injury to children, the handicapped, and senior citizens.",
            "(7) Probability of exposure to hazard. The Commission may also consider several other things which can help to determine the likelihood that a consumer would be injured by a product thought to be hazardous. These are the number of units of the product that are being used by consumers, the frequency with which such use occurs, and the likelihood that in the course of typical use the consumer would be exposed to the identified risk of injury.",
            "(8) Additional criteria. Additional criteria may arise that the staff believes warrant the Commission's attention. The Commission encourages the inclusion of such criteria for its consideration in establishing priorities. The Commission recognizes that incontrovertible data related to the criteria identified in this policy statement may be difficult to locate or develop on a timely basis. Therefore, the Commission may not require extensive documentation on each and every criterion before making a decision. In addition, the Commission emphasizes that the order of listing of the criteria in this policy is not intended to indicate either the order in which they are to be considered or their relative importance. The Commission will consider all the criteria to the extent feasible in each case, and as interactively or jointly as possible."

            "(a) This document states the Consumer Product Safety Commission's policy with respect to emergency requests for exemptions for companies which inadvertently produce products that do not conform to Commission regulations issued under the five acts the Commission administers. These acts are the Consumer Product Safety Act, the Federal Hazardous Substances Act, the Flammable Fabrics Act, the Poison Prevention Packaging Act of 1970 and the Refrigerator Safety Act. While the Commission is reluctant to grant such requests, it believes that the public should be apprised of the manner in which it rules on exemption requests and therefore is publishing the policy to provide guidance to industry and others making such requests. The publication of the policy will also serve to inform the public of the criteria that the Commission uses in ruling upon such requests. This policy is intended to cover emergency requests for exemptions and, while relevant, is not intended to limit the discretion of CPSC staff to close or not to open cases in the routine enforcement of CPSC regulations.",

The policy lists criteria the Commission considers in deciding whether to grant or deny an exemption request and therefore, should provide guidance to companies on the types of information to be submitted with requests. In addition, published Commission procedures regarding petitioning for amendments to regulations may assist companies in determining what supporting data to submit with a request. (See, for example, existing Commission procedures at 16 CFR 1110, 16 CFR 1607.14, 16 CFR 1500.82 and 16 CFR 1500.201). The exemption requests themselves should be filed with the Office of the Secretary of the Commission.",
            "(c) It is the general policy of the Commission that when a particular exemption request is made and granted, all similarly situated persons are accorded the same relief as the person who requested the exemption. Therefore, when any amendment to a Commission regulation is proposed or a statement of enforcement policy is issued, the document to the extent practicable will be phrased in objective terms so that all similarly situated persons will be able to determine whether their products would fall within the relief.",
            "(d) In deciding whether to grant or deny an exemption request, the Commission considers the following general criteria:",
            "(1) The degree to which the exemption if granted would expose consumers to an increased risk of injury: The Commission does not believe it should exempt products which would present a significantly greater risk to consumers than complying products. Therefore, the Commission will not grant exemption requests in such cases.",
            "(2) The cost to the Commission of granting emergency requests: Granting emergency exemption requests will in most cases require drafting a proposed and a final amendment or a statement of enforcement policy for publication in the Federal Register. Such action may also require the Commission to monitor the sale or distribution of the products. These activities consume scarce Commission resources. In some instances, the costs to the Commission may exceed the benefit to be derived by a company and similarly situated companies. If so, the Commission may deny the request on this ground.",
            "(3) The precedential effect of exempting some products: The Commission recognizes that decisions to exempt some products set precedents in at least two ways. First, they indicate to companies that the CPSC will permit deviations to a given regulation. Second, they indicate to companies that the CPSC will permit deviations to regulations in general. Both precedents, if set carelessly by the CPSC, could result in many requests for exemption and could undermine the stability and integrity of the Commission's regulations.",
            "(e) In deciding whether to grant or deny an exemption request, the Commission also considers the following factors which relate specifically to the company making the request: (If the request is granted, all similarly situated companies, however, will be accorded the same relief).",
            "(1) The nature of the emergency exemption request: The Commission will not reward bad quality control or faulty design work by permitting companies to market their mistakes. Although it is difficult to detail specific instances, the Commission is sympathetic to companies that produced noncomplying products due to factors beyond their immediate control or despite their best efforts.",
            "(2) The economic loss which a company will suffer if its emergency request is denied: The greater the loss a company may suffer the more likely the Commission will favorably consider an exemption. However, the Commission does not believe economic loss alone should be determinative of an emergency exemption request.",
            "(3) The fairness to competitors: The Commission is reluctant to grant relief if it could place the company at an unfair competitive advantage over other companies which have successfully complied with the same regulation. Therefore, the Commission will afford the same relief to similarly situated companies, and will decline to grant a request where unfair competitive advantage may result."

            "(a) According to the legislative history of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 1990, the purpose of section 37 is to increase the reporting of information to the Commission that will assist it in carrying out its responsibilities.",
            "(b) Section 37(c)(1) requires a manufacturer or importer (hereinafter \u201cmanufacturer\u201d) to include in a section 37 report a statement as to whether a civil action that is the subject of the report alleged death or grievous bodily injury. Furthermore, under section 37(c)(2), a manufacturer may specifically deny that the information it submits pursuant to section 37 reasonably supports the conclusion that its consumer product caused a death or grievous bodily injury, and may also include any additional information that it chooses to provide. In view of the foregoing, the reporting obligation is not limited to those cases in which a product has been adjudicated as the cause of death or grievous injury or to those settled or adjudicated cases in which the manufacturer has satisfied itself that the product was the cause of such trauma. Rather, when the specific injury alleged by the plaintiff meets the definition of \u201cgrievous bodily injury\u201d contained in \u00a7 1116.2(b) of this part, the lawsuit falls within the scope of section 37 after settlement or adjudication. The manufacturer's opinion as to the validity of the allegation is irrelevant for reporting purposes. The category of injury alleged may be clear from the face of an original or amended complaint in a case or may reasonably be determined during pre-complaint investigation, post-complaint discovery, or informal settlement negotiation. Conclusory language in a complaint that the plaintiff suffered grievous bodily injury without further elaboration raises a presumption that the injury falls within one of the statutory categories, but is insufficient in itself to bring the suit within the ambit of the statute, unless the defendant manufacturer elects to settle such a matter without any investigation of the underlying facts. A case alleging the occurrence of grievous bodily injury in which a litigated verdict contains express findings that the injury suffered by the plaintiff did not meet the statutory criteria is also not reportable. Should a manufacturer believe that its product is wrongly implicated in an action, the statute expressly incorporates the mechanism for the manufacturer to communicate that belief to the Commission by denying in the report the involvement of the product or that the injury in fact suffered by the plaintiff was not grievous bodily injury, despite the plaintiff's allegations to the contrary. In addition, the statute imposes stringent confidentiality requirements on the disclosure by the Commission or the Department of Justice of information submitted pursuant to sections 37(c)(1) and 37(c)(2)(A). Moreover, it specifies that the reporting of a civil action shall not constitute an admission of liability under any statute or common law or under the relevant provisions of the Consumer Product Safety Act. In view of these safeguards, the reporting of lawsuits alleging the occurrence of death or grievous injury should have little adverse effect on manufacturers.",
            "(c) Section 37 applies to judgments and \u201cfinal settlements\u201d. Accordingly, the date on which a civil action is filed or the date on which the product that is the subject of such an action was manufactured is irrelevant to the obligation to report. A settlement is final upon the entry by a court of an order disposing of a civil action with respect to the manufacturer of the product that is the subject of the action, even through the case may continue with respect to other defendants.",
            "(d) A judgment becomes reportable upon the entry of a final order by the trial court disposing of the matter in favor of the plaintiff and from which an appeal lies. Because section 37(c)(2) specifies that a reporting manufacturer may include a statement that a judgment in favor of a plaintiff is under appeal or is expected to be appealed, Congress clearly intended section 37 to apply prior to the exhaustion of or even the initiation of action to seek appellate remedies.",
            "(e) No language in section 37 limits the reporting obligation to those litigated cases in which the plaintiff prevails completely. Therefore, if a court enters a partial judgment in favor of the plaintiff, the judgment is reportable, unless it is unrelated to the product that is the subject of the suit. For example, if a manufacturer's product is exonerated during a suit, but liability is assessed against another defendant, the manufacturer need not report under section 37.",
            "(f)(1) Section 37 applies to civil actions that allege the involvement of a particular model of a consumer product in death or grievous bodily injury. Section 3(a) of the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2052(a)) defines a \u201cconsumer product\u201d as any article, or component part thereof, produced or distributed for sale to a consumer for use in or around a permanent or temporary household or residence, a school, in recreation, or otherwise, or for the personal use, consumption, or enjoyment of a consumer in or around a permanent or temporary household or residence, a school, in recreation, or otherwise. The term \u201cconsumer product\u201d does not include any article which is not customarily produced or distributed for sale to, or use or consumption by, or enjoyment of, a consumer.",
            "(2) Since section 37 focuses on consumer products, it is the responsibility of the manufacturer of a product implicated in a civil action to determine whether the production or distribution of the product satisfies the statutory criteria of section 3(a). If it does, the action falls within the ambit of section 37. True industrial products are beyond the scope of section 37. However, if a lawsuit is based on an allegation of injury involving a consumer product, that suit falls within the scope of section 37, even though the injury may have occurred during the use of the product in employment. By the same token, occupational injuries arising during the fabrication of a consumer product are not reportable if the entity involved in the injury is not a consumer product at the time the injury occurs. In determining whether a product meets the statutory definition, manufacturers may wish to consult the relevant case law and the advisory opinions issued by the Commission's Office of the General Counsel. The unique circumstances surrounding litigation involving asbestos-containing products warrant one exception to this analysis. The Commission, as a matter of agency discretion, will require manufacturers of such products to report under section 37 only those lawsuits that allege the occurrence of death or grievous bodily injury as the result of exposure to asbestos from a particular model of a consumer product purchased by a consumer for personal use. Such lawsuits would include not only injury to the purchaser, but also to other consumers including family, subsequent property owners, and visitors. The Commission may consider granting similar relief to manufacturers of other products that present a risk of chronic injury similar to that presented by asbestos. Any such request must contain documented evidence demonstrating that compliance with the reporting requirements will be unduly burdensome and will be unlikely to produce information that will assist the Commission in carrying out its obligations under the statutes it administers.",
            "(g) The definition of \u201cconsumer product\u201d also encompasses a variety of products that are subject to regulation under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (15 U.S.C. 1261 et seq.), the Poison Prevention Packaging Act (15 U.S.C. 1471 et seq.), the Flammable Fabrics Act (15 U.S.C. 1191 et seq.), and the Refrigerator Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1211 et seq.). Lawsuits involving such products are also subject to section 37, notwithstanding the fact that the products may be regulated or subject to regulation under one of the other statutes.",
            "(h) Relationship of Section 37 to Section 15 of the CPSA. (1) Section 37 plays a complementary role to the reporting requirements of section 15(b) of the CPSA (15 U.S.C. 2064(b)). Section 15(b) establishes a substantial obligation for firms to review information as it becomes available to determine whether an obligation to report exists. Accordingly, the responsibility to report under section 15(b) may arise long before enough lawsuits involving a product are resolved to create the obligation to report under section 37. The enactment of section 15(b)(3) in the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 1990 reinforces this expectation. Under this amendment, manufacturers must report to the Commission when they obtain information that reasonably supports the conclusion that a product creates an unreasonable risk of serious injury or death. Previously, the reporting obligation for unregulated products only arose when available information indicated that the product in question was defective and created a substantial product hazard because of the pattern of the defect, the severity of the risk of injury, the number of products distributed in commerce, etc. The effect of the 1990 amendment is discussed in detail in the Commission's interpretative rule relating to the reporting of substantial product hazards at 16 CFR part 1115.",
            "(2) The new substantive reporting requirements of section 15(b)(3) support the conclusion that Congress intended section 37 to capture product-related accident information that has not been reported under section 15(b). Between the time a firm learns of an incident or problem involving a product that raises safety-related concerns and the time that a lawsuit involving that product is resolved by settlement or adjudication, the firm generally has numerous opportunities to evaluate whether a section 15 report is appropriate. Such evaluation might be appropriate, for example, after an analysis of product returns, the receipt of an insurance investigator's report, a physical examination of the product, the interview or deposition of an injured party or an eyewitness to the event that gave rise to the lawsuit, or even preparation of the firm's responses to plaintiff's discovery requests. Even if a manufacturer does not believe that a report is required prior to the resolution of a single lawsuit, an obligation to investigate whether a report is appropriate may arise if, for example, a verdict in favor of the plaintiff raises the issue of whether the product in question creates an unreasonable risk of death or serious injury.",
            "(3) In contrast, the application of section 37 does not involve the discretionary judgment and subjective analyses of hazard and causation associated with section 15 reports. Once the statutory criteria of three settled or adjudicated civil actions alleging grievous injury or death in a two year period are met, the obligation to report under section 37 is automatic. For this reason, the Commission regards section 37 as a \u201csafety net\u201d to surface product hazards that remain unreported either intentionally or by inadvertence. The provisions in the law limiting such reports to cases in which three or more lawsuits alleging grievous injury or death are settled or adjudicated in favor of plaintiffs during a two year period provide assurance that the product involved presents a sufficiently grave risk of injury to warrant consideration by the Commission. Indeed, once the obligation to report under section 37 arises, the obligation to file a section 15 report concurrently may exist if the information available to the manufacturer meets the criteria established in section 15(b) for reporting.",
            "(4) Section 37 contains no specific record keeping requirements. However, to track and catalog lawsuits to determine whether they are reportable, prudent manufacturers will develop and maintain information systems to index and retain lawsuit data. In the absence of a prior section 15 report, once such systems are in place, such manufacturers will be in a position to perform a two-fold analysis to determine whether the information contained in such systems is reportable under either section 15(b) or 37. A manufacturer might conclude, for example, that the differences between products that are the subject of different lawsuits make them different models or that the type of injury alleged in one or more of the suits is not grievous bodily injury. Based on this analysis, the manufacturer might also conclude that the suits are thus not reportable under section 37. However, a reporting obligation under section 15 may exist in any event if the same information reasonably supports the conclusion that the product(s) contain a defect which could create a substantial product hazard or create an unreasonable risk of serious injury or death."

            "(a) The obligation rests with the manufacturer of a product to determine whether a reasonable basis exists to conclude that a product that is the subject of a settled or adjudicated lawsuit is sufficiently different from other similar products to be regarded as a \u201cparticular model\u201d under section 37 because it is \u201cdistinctive.\u201d To determine whether a product is \u201cdistinctive\u201d, the proper inquiry should be directed toward the degree to which a product differs from other comparable products in one or more of the characteristics enumerated in section 37(e)(2) and \u00a7 1116.2(c) of this part. A product is \u201cdistinctive\u201d if, after an analysis of information relating to one or more of the statutory characteristics, a manufacturer, acting in accordance with the customs and practices of the trade of which it is a member, could reasonably conclude that the difference between that product and other items of the same product class manufactured or imported by the same manufacturer is substantial and material.

            "(8) Retail price. Substantial variations in price arising directly from the characteristics enumerated in section 37(e)(2) for evaluating product models may be evidence that products are different models because their differences are distinctive. Price variations imposed to accommodate different markets or vendors are not sufficient to draw such a distinction.",
            "(9) Manufacturer's designation, model number, or private label designation. These factors are not controlling in identifying \u201cparticular models\u201d.",
            "(10) Expert evaluation of the characteristics of the products in question, and surveys of consumer users or a manufacturer's retail customers.",
            "(b) The definition of \u201cconsumer product\u201d expressly applies to components of consumer products. Should a component manufacturer be joined in a civil action against a manufacturer of a consumer product, the section 37 reporting requirements may apply to that manufacturer after a combination of three judgments or settlements involving the same component model during a two year period, even though the manufacturer of the finished product is exempt from such reporting because the lawsuits do not involve the same particular model of the finished consumer product. The same proposition holds true for common components used in different consumer products. If the manufacturer of such a component is a defendant in three suits and the requisite statutory criteria are met, the reporting obligations apply.",
            "(c) Section 37 expressly defines the reporting obligation in terms of the particular model of a product rather than the manner in which a product was involved in an accident. Accordingly, even if the characteristic of a product that caused or resulted in the deaths of grievous injuries alleged in three or more civil actions is the same in all of the suits, the requirement to report under section 37 would arise only if the same particular model was involved in at least three of the suits. However, the existence of such a pattern would strongly suggest that the obligation to file a report under section 15(b) (2) or (3) (15 U.S.C. 2064(b) (2) or (3)) exists because the information reasonably supports the conclusion that the product contains a defect that could present a substantial risk of injury to the public or creates an unreasonable risk of serious injury or death.",
            "(d) Section 37 does not require that the same category of injury be involved in multiple lawsuits for the reporting obligation to arise. As long as a particular model of a consumer product is the subject of at least three civil actions that are settled or adjudicated in favor of the plaintiff in one of the statutory two year periods, the manufacturer must report, even though the alleged category of injury and the alleged causal relationship of the product to the injury in each suit may differ."

            "(b) The prohibition contained in section 6(e) (15 U.S.C. 2055(e)) against the disclosure of information submitted pursuant to section 37 only applies to the specific items of information that a manufacturer is required to submit under section 37(c)(1) and to statements under section 37(c)(2)(A) relating to the possibility or existence of an appeal of a reported judgment adverse to a manufacturer. Section 6(e)(1) does not, by its terms, apply to information that the manufacturer voluntarily chooses to submit pursuant to section 37(c)(2)(B). Thus, disclosure of such information is governed by the other provisions of section 6 of the CPSA (15 U.S.C. 2055) and by the interpretative rules issued by the Commission (16 CFR parts 1101 and 1015). For example, if a manufacturer includes information otherwise reportable under section 15 as part of a section 37 report, the Commission will treat the information reported pursuant to section 15 as \u201cadditional information\u201d submitted pursuant to section 37(c)(2)(B). Generally, any issue of the public disclosure of that information will be controlled by the relevant provisions of section 6(b), including section 6(b)(5) relating to the disclosure of substantial product hazard reports, and section 6(a) relating to the disclosure of confidential or trade secret information. However, to the extent the section 15 report reiterates or references information reported under section 37, the confidentiality provisions of section 6(e) still apply to the reiteration or reference. In addition, interpretative regulations issued under section 6(b) of the Act establish that disclosure of certain information may be barred if the disclosure would not be fair in the circumstances. 16 CFR 1101.33. Accordingly, issues of releasing additional information submitted pursuant to section 37 will also be evaluated under the fairness provisions of section 6(b). Should the Commission receive a request for such information or contemplate disclosure on its own initiative, the manufacturer will be given an opportunity to present arguments to the Commission why the information should not be disclosed, including, if appropriate, why disclosure of the information would be unfair in the circumstances. Among the factors the Commission will consider in evaluating the fairness of releasing the information are the nature of the information, the fact that it is an adjunct to a Congressional protected report, and whether the information in question supports the conclusion that a section 37 or 15(b), CPSA, report should have been filed earlier.",
            "(c) Section 6(e) imposes no confidentiality requirements on information obtained by the Commission independently of a report pursuant to section 37. The provisions of section 6(b) govern the disclosure of such information."

These factors are:",

            "(A) The severity of the risk of injury;",
            "(B) The occurrence or absence of injury;",
            "(C) The appropriateness of such penalty in relation to the size of the business of the person charged; and",
            "(D) Such other factors as appropriate.",
            "(2) The nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation. Under this factor, the Commission will consider the totality of the circumstances and all other facts concerning a violation. The Commission will consider the enumerated statutory factors, as well as the factors described in paragraph (b) of this section.",
            "(3) Nature of the product defect. The Commission will consider the nature of the product defect associated with a CPSA violation. This consideration will include, for example, whether the defect arises from the product's design, composition, contents, construction, manufacture, packaging, warnings, or instructions, and will include consideration of conditions or circumstances in which the defect arises. The Commission will also consider the nature of the substance associated with an FHSA violation. Two of the statutory factors in the CPSA civil penalty factors include the terms \u201cproduct defect\u201d or \u201cdefective products.\u201d However, certain violations of the CPSA, for example, failing to supply a required certificate that the product complies with an applicable consumer product safety rule, do not necessarily require that there be a product defect or defective product. The terms \u201cproduct defect\u201d or \u201cdefective products\u201d would not apply to such situation. In such cases, however, the other civil penalty factors would still be considered.",
            "(4) Severity of the risk of injury. Consistent with its discussion of severity of the risk at 16 CFR 1115.12, the Commission will consider, among other factors, the potential for serious injury, illness, or death (and whether any injury or illness required medical treatment including hospitalization or surgery); the likelihood of injury; the intended or reasonably foreseeable use or misuse of the product; and the population at risk (including vulnerable populations such as children, the elderly, or those with disabilities).",
            "(5) The occurrence or absence of injury. The Commission will consider whether injuries, illnesses, or deaths have or have not occurred with respect to any product or substance associated with a violation, and, if so, the number and nature of injuries, illnesses, or deaths. Both acute illnesses and the likelihood of chronic illnesses will be considered.",
            "(6) The number of defective products distributed. The Commission will consider the number of defective products or amount of substance distributed in commerce. The statutory language makes no distinction between those defective products distributed in commerce that consumers received and those defective products distributed in commerce that consumers have not received. Therefore both could be considered in appropriate cases. This factor will not be used to penalize a person's decision to conduct a wider-than-necessary recall out of an abundance of caution. This would not include situations where such a recall is conducted due to a person's uncertainty concerning how many or which products may need to be recalled.",
            "(7) The appropriateness of such penalty in relation to the size of the business of the person charged, including how to mitigate undue adverse economic impacts on small businesses.",
            "(i) The Commission is required to consider the size of the business of the person charged in relation to the amount of the penalty. This factor reflects the relationship between the size of a business and the policies behind, and purposes of, a penalty (as noted above in \u00a7 1119.1). In considering business size, the Commission may look to several factors including, but not limited to, the number of employees, net worth, and annual sales. A business's size and a business's ability to pay a penalty are separate considerations. In some cases for small businesses, however, these two considerations may relate to each other. The Commission will be guided, where appropriate, by relevant financial factors to determine a small business's ability to pay a penalty, including, but not limited to, liquidity, solvency, and profitability. The burden to present clear, reliable, relevant, and sufficient evidence relating to a business's size and ability to pay rests on the business.",
            "(ii) The statute requires the Commission to consider how to mitigate the adverse economic impacts on small businesses only if those impacts would be undue. What the Commission considers in determining what is undue may include, but is not limited to, the business's size and financial factors relating to its ability to pay. When considering how to mitigate undue adverse economic impacts, the Commission will, as appropriate, also follow its Small Business Enforcement Policy set forth at \u00a7 1020.5.",
            "(b) Other factors as appropriate. In determining the amount of any civil penalty to be sought for a violation of the CPSA, FHSA, or FFA, the Commission may consider, as appropriate, such other factors in addition to those listed in the statutes. Both the Commission and a person may raise any factors they believe are relevant in determining an appropriate penalty amount. A person will be notified of any factors beyond those enumerated in the statutes that the Commission relies on as aggravating factors for purposes of determining a civil penalty amount. Additional factors that may be considered in a case include, but are not limited to, the following:",
            "(1) Safety/compliance program and/or system relating to a violation. The Commission may consider, when a safety/compliance program and/or system as established is relevant to a violation, whether a person had at the time of the violation a reasonable and effective program or system for collecting and analyzing information related to safety issues. Examples of such information would include incident reports, lawsuits, warranty claims, and safety-related issues related to repairs or returns. The Commission may also consider whether a person conducted adequate and relevant premarket and production testing of the product at issue; had a program in place for continued compliance with all relevant mandatory and voluntary safety standards; and other factors as the Commission deems appropriate. The burden to present clear, reliable, relevant, and sufficient evidence of such program, system, or testing rests on the person seeking consideration of this factor.",
            "(2) History of noncompliance. The Commission may consider whether or not a person's history of noncompliance with the CPSA, FHSA, FFA, and other laws that the CPSC enforces, and the regulations thereunder, should increase the amount of the penalty. A person's history of noncompliance may be indicated by, for example, multiple violations of one or more laws or regulations that the CPSC enforces, including repeated violations of the same law or regulation. History of noncompliance may include the number of previous violations or how recently a previous violation occurred.",
            "(3) Economic gain from noncompliance. The Commission may consider whether a person benefitted economically from a failure to comply, including a delay in complying, with the CPSA, FHSA, FFA, and other laws that the CPSC enforces, and the regulations thereunder.",
            "(4) Failure to respond in a timely and complete fashion to the Commission's requests for information or remedial action. The Commission may consider whether a person's failure to respond in a timely and complete fashion to requests from the Commission for information or for remedial action should increase a penalty. This factor is intended to address a person's dilatory and egregious conduct in responding to written requests for information or remedial action sought by the Commission, but not to impede any person's lawful rights."

Such lighting products include lighted decorative outfits, such as stars, wreathes, candles without shades, light sculptures, blow-molded (plastic) figures, and animated figures. Lighting products outside the scope of the rule include: Battery-operated products; solar-powered products; products that operate from a transformer or low-voltage power supply; flexible lighting products incorporating non-replaceable series and series/parallel connected lamps enclosed within a flexible polymeric tube or extrusion; and portable electric lamps that are used to illuminate seasonal decorations.",
            "(e) Extension cord (also known as a cord set) means a length of factory-assembled flexible cord with an attachment plug or current tap as a line fitting and with a cord connector as a load fitting. Extension cords are used for extending a branch circuit supply of an electrical outlet to the power-supply cord of a portable appliance, in accordance with the National Electrical Code.\u00ae For purposes of this rule, the term applies to extension cords that are equipped with National Electrical Manufacturer Association (\u201cNEMA\u201d) 1-15, 5-15 and 5-20 fittings, and that are intended for indoor use only, or for both indoor and outdoor use. The term \u201cextension cord\u201d does not include detachable power supply cords, appliance cords, power strips and taps, and adaptor cords supplied with outdoor tools and yard equipment.",

Even when the seller, manufacturer, or distributor modifies a pre-assembled product by adjusting to size, attaching the top rail or bottom rail, or tying cords to secure the bottom rail, the product is still considered stock. Online sales of the product or the size of the order such as multi-family housing do not make the product a non-stock product. These examples are provided in ANSI/WCMA A100.1\u20142018 (incorporated by reference; see \u00a7 1120.4) to clarify that as long as the product is \u201csubstantially fabricated\u201d prior to distribution in commerce, subsequent changes to the product do not change its categorization.",

For example, a coat sized 12 through 14 remains subject to the prohibition of hood and neck area drawstrings, even though this requirement of ASTM F 1816-97 only applies to garments up to size 12. A coat size 13 through 15 would not be considered within the scope of ASTM F 1816-97's prohibition of neck and hood drawstrings, but would be subject to the requirements for waist or bottom drawstrings.",

Section 108 of the CPSIA also prohibits, on an interim basis, \u201ctoys that can be placed in a child's mouth\u201d or \u201cchild care article\u201d containing more than 0.1 percent of three additional phthalates (diisononyl phthalate (DINP), diisodecyl phthalate (DIDP), and di-n-octyl phthalate (DnOP)). A \u201cchildren's toy\u201d is defined as a consumer product designed or intended by the manufacturer for a child 12 years of age or younger for use by the child when the child plays. A toy can be placed in a child's mouth if any part of the toy can actually be brought to the mouth and kept in the mouth by a child so that it can be sucked and chewed. If the children's product can only be licked, it is not regarded as able to be placed in the mouth. If a toy or part of a toy in one dimension is smaller than 5 centimeters, it can be placed in the mouth. The term \u201cchild care article\u201d means a consumer product designed or intended by the manufacturer to facilitate sleep or the feeding of children age 3 years and younger, or to help such children with sucking or teething.",
            "(b) Section 108(d) of the CPSIA provides that the prohibitions in paragraph (a) of this section do not apply to component parts of a children's toy or child care article that are not accessible to children through normal and reasonably foreseeable use and abuse of such product, as determined by the Commission. A component part is not accessible if it is not physically exposed, by reason of a sealed covering or casing, and does not become physically exposed through reasonably foreseeable use and abuse of the product, including swallowing, mouthing, breaking, or other children's activities, and the aging of the product.",
            "(c) Section 108(d)(3) of the CPSIA directs the Commission to promulgate a rule to provide guidance with respect to what product components or classes of components will be considered to be inaccessible for a children's toy or child care article that contains phthalates or adopt the same guidance with respect to inaccessibility that was adopted by the Commission with regard to accessibility of lead under section 101(b)(2)(B) (15 U.S.C. 1278a(b)(2)(B)), with additional consideration, as appropriate, of whether such component can be placed in a child's mouth. 15 U.S.C. 2057c(d)(3). The Commission adopts the same guidance with respect to inaccessibility for the phthalates that was adopted by the Commission with regard to accessibility of lead, however, vinyl (or other plasticized material) covered mattresses/sleep surfaces, that contain phthalates that are designed or intended by the manufacturer to facilitate sleep of children age 3 and younger, are considered accessible and would not be considered inaccessible through the use of fabric coverings, including sheets and mattress pads.",
            "(d) The accessibility probes specified for sharp points or edges under the Commission's regulations at 16 CFR 1500.48-1500.49 should be used to assess the accessibility of phthalate-containing component parts of a children's toy or child care article. A phthalate-containing component part would be considered accessible if it can be contacted by any portion of the specified segment of the accessibility probe. A phthalate-containing component part would be considered inaccessible if it cannot be contacted by any portion of the specified segment of the accessibility probe.",
            "(e) For children's toys or child care articles intended for children that are 18 months of age or younger, the use and abuse tests set forth under the Commission's regulations at 16 CFR 1500.50 and 16 CFR 1500.51 (excluding the bite test of \u00a7 1500.51(c)), should be used to evaluate accessibility of phthalate-containing component parts of a children's toy or child care article as a result of normal and reasonably foreseeable use and abuse of the product.",
            "(f) For children's toys or child care articles intended for children that are over 18 months, but not over 36 months of age, the use and abuse tests set forth under the Commission's regulations at 16 CFR 1500.50 and 16 CFR 1500.52 (excluding the bite test of \u00a7 1500.52(c)), should be used to evaluate accessibility of phthalate-containing component parts of a children's toy or child care article as a result of normal and reasonably foreseeable use and abuse of the product.",
            "(g) For children's toys intended for children that are over 36 months, but not over 96 months of age, the use and abuse tests set forth under the Commission's regulations at 16 CFR 1500.50 and 16 CFR 1500.53 (excluding the bite test of \u00a7 1500.53(c)), should be used to evaluate accessibility of phthalate-containing component parts of a children's toy as a result of normal and reasonably foreseeable use and abuse of the product.",
            "(h) For children's toys intended for children over 96 months through 12 years of age, the use and abuse tests set forth under the Commission's regulations at 16 CFR 1500.50 and 16 CFR 1500.53 (excluding the bite test of \u00a7 1500.53(c)) intended for children ages 37-96 months should be used to evaluate accessibility of phthalate-containing component parts of a children's toy as a result of normal and reasonably foreseeable use and abuse of the product.",
            "(i) Because the Commission adopts the same guidance with respect to inaccessibility for phthalates that was adopted by the Commission with regard to inaccessibility of lead, paint, coatings, and electroplating may not be considered a barrier that would render phthalate-containing component parts of toys and child care articles inaccessible. A children's toy or child care article that is or contains a phthalate-containing part that is enclosed, encased, or covered by fabric and passes the appropriate use and abuse tests on such covers, is considered inaccessible to a child, unless the product or part of the product, in one dimension, is smaller than 5 centimeters. However, vinyl (or other plasticized material) covered mattresses/sleep surfaces that contain phthalates that are designed or intended by the manufacturer to facilitate sleep of children age 3 and younger, are considered accessible and would not be considered inaccessible through the use of fabric coverings, including sheets and mattress pads.",
            "(j) The intentional disassembly or destruction of products by children older than age 8 years, by means or knowledge not generally available to younger children, including use of tools, will not be considered in evaluating products for accessibility of phthalate-containing components."

          "paragraphs": [
            "(a) Definition of \u201cChildren's Product\u201d\u2014(1) Under section 3(a)(2) of the Consumer Product Safety Act (CPSA), a children's product means a consumer product designed or intended primarily for children 12 years of age or younger. The term \u201cdesigned or intended primarily\u201d applies to those consumer products mainly for children 12 years old or younger. Whether a product is primarily intended for children 12 years of age or younger is determined by considering the four specified statutory factors. These factors are:",
            "(i) A statement by a manufacturer about the intended use of such product, including a label on such product if such statement is reasonable.",
            "(ii) Whether the product is represented in its packaging, display, promotion, or advertising as appropriate for use by children 12 years of age or younger.",
            "(iii) Whether the product is commonly recognized by consumers as being intended for use by a child 12 years of age or younger.",
            "(iv) The Age Determination Guidelines issued by the Commission staff in September 2002 and any successor to such guidelines.",
            "(2) The examples discussed herein may also be illustrative in making such determinations; however, the determination of whether a product meets the definition of a children's product depends on factual information that may be unique to each product and, therefore, would need to be made on a case-by-case basis. The term \u201cfor use\u201d by children 12 years or younger generally means that children will physically interact with such products based on the reasonably foreseeable use of such product. Toys and articles that are subject to the small parts regulations at 16 CFR Part 1501 and in ASTM F963 would fall within the definition of children's product since they are intended for children 12 years of age or younger. Toys and other articles intended for children up to 96 months (8 years old) that are subject to the requirements at 16 CFR 1500.48 through 1500.49 and 16 CFR 1500.50 through 1500.53 would similarly fall within the definition of children's product given their age grading for these other regulations. Therefore, a manufacturer could reasonably conclude on the basis of the age grading for these other regulations that its product also must comply with all requirements applicable to children's products including, but not limited to, those under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act, ASTM F963, \u201cStandard Consumer Safety Specification for Toy Safety,\u201d and the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008.",
            "(b) Definition of \u201cGeneral Use Product\u201d\u2014(1) A general use product means a consumer product that is not designed or intended primarily for use by children 12 years old or younger. General use products are those consumer products designed or intended primarily for consumers older than age 12. Some products may be designed or intended for use by consumers of all ages, including children 12 years old or younger, but are intended mainly for consumers older than 12 years of age. Examples of general use products may include products with which a child would not likely interact, or products with which consumers older than 12 would be as likely, or more likely to interact. Products used by children 12 years of age or younger that have a declining appeal for teenagers are likely to be considered children's products.",
            "(2) Other products are specifically not intended for children 12 years of age or younger. These products, such as cigarette lighters, candles, and fireworks, which the Commission has traditionally warned adults to keep away from children, are not subject to the CPSIA's lead limits, tracking label requirement, and third-party testing and certification provisions. Similarly, products that incorporate performance requirements for child resistance are not children's products as they are designed specifically to ensure that children cannot access the contents. This would include products such as portable gasoline containers and special packaging under the Poison Prevention Packaging Act.",
            "(c) Factors Considered\u2014To determine whether a consumer product is primarily intended for a child 12 years of age or younger the four specified statutory factors must be considered together as a whole. The following four factors must be considered:",
            "(1) A statement by a manufacturer about the intended use of such product, including a label on such product if such statement is reasonable. A manufacturer's statement about the product's intended use, including the product's label, should be reasonably consistent with the expected use patterns for a product. A manufacturer's statement that the product is not intended for children does not preclude a product from being regulated as a children's product if the primary appeal of the product is to children 12 years of age or younger, as indicated, for example, by decorations or embellishments that invite use by the child, being sized for a child or being marketed to appeal primarily to children. Similarly, a label indicating that a product is for ages 9 and up does not necessarily make it a children's product if it is a general use product. Such a label may recommend 9 years old as the earliest age for a prospective user, but may or may not indicate the age for which the product is primarily intended. The manufacturer's label, in and of itself, is not considered to be determinative.",
            "(2) Whether the product is represented in its packaging, display, promotion, or advertising as appropriate for use by children 12 years of age or younger.",
            "(i) These representations may be express or implied. For example, advertising by the manufacturer expressly declaring that the product is intended for children 12 years of age or younger will support a determination that a product is a children's product. While, for example advertising by the manufacturer showing children 12 years of age or younger using the product may support a determination that the product is a children's product. These representations may be found in packaging, text, illustrations and/or photographs depicting consumers using the product, instructions, assembly manuals, or advertising media used to market the product.",
            "(ii) The product's physical location near, or visual association with, children's products may be a factor in making an age determination, but is not determinative. For example, a product displayed in a children's toy section of a store may support a determination that the product is a children's product. However, where that same product is also sold in department stores and marketed for general use, further evaluation would be necessary. The Commission recognizes that manufacturers do not necessarily control where a product will be placed in a retail establishment and such lack of control will be considered. The Commission evaluates products more broadly than on a shelf-by-shelf or store-by-store basis.",
            "(iii) The product's association or marketing in conjunction with nonchildren's products may not be determinative as to whether the product is a children's product. For example, packaging and selling a stuffed animal with a candle would not preclude a determination that the stuffed animal is a children's product since stuffed animals are commonly recognized as being primarily intended for children.",
            "(3) Whether the product is commonly recognized by consumers as being intended for use by children 12 years of age or younger. Consumer perception of the product's use by children, including its reasonably foreseeable use, will be evaluated. Sales data, market analyses, focus group testing, and other marketing studies may help support an analysis regarding this factor.",
            "(i) Features and Characteristics\u2014additional considerations that may help distinguish children's products from nonchildren's products include:",
            "(A) Small sizes that would not be comfortable for the average adult;",
            "(B) Exaggerated features (large buttons, bright indicators) that simplify the product's use;",
            "(C) Safety features that are not found on similar products intended for adults;",
            "(D) Colors commonly associated with childhood (pinks, blues, bright primary colors);",
            "(E) Decorative motifs commonly associated with childhood (such as animals, insects, small vehicles, alphabets, dolls, clowns, and puppets);",
            "(F) Features that do not enhance the product's utility (such as cartoons) but contribute to its attractiveness to children 12 years of age or younger; and",
            "(G) Play value, i.e., features primarily attractive to children 12 years of age or younger that promote interactive exploration and imagination for fanciful purposes (whimsical activities lacking utility for accomplishing mundane tasks; actions performed for entertainment and amusement).",
            "(ii) Principal use of the product\u2014the principal uses of a product take precedence over other actions that are less likely to be performed with a product. For example, when a child pretends that a broom is a horse, that does not mean the item is a children's product because the broom's principal use is for sweeping;",
            "(iii) Cost\u2014the cost of a given product may influence the determination of the age of intended users; and",
            "(iv) Children's interactions, if any, with the product\u2014products for use in a child's environment by the caregiver but not for use by the child would not be considered to be primarily intended for a child 12 years of age or younger.",
            "(4) The Age Determination Guidelines issued by the Consumer Product Safety Commission staff in September 2002, and any successor to such guidelines. The product's appeal to different age groups and the capabilities of those age groups may be considered when making determinations about the appropriate user groups for products.",
            "(d) Examples\u2014To help manufacturers understand what constitutes a children's product under the CPSA, the following additional examples regarding specific product categories are offered:",
            "(1) Furnishings and Fixtures\u2014General home furnishings and fixtures (including, but not limited to: Rocking chairs, shelving units, televisions, digital music players, ceiling fans, humidifiers, air purifiers, window curtains, tissue boxes, rugs, carpets, lamps, clothing hooks and racks) that often are found in children's rooms or schools would not be considered children's products unless they are decorated or embellished with a childish theme and invite use by a child 12 years of age or younger, are sized for a child, or are marketed to appeal primarily to children. Examples of home or school furnishings that are designed or intended primarily for use by children and considered children's products include: Infant tubs, bath seats, small bean bag chairs with childish decorations, beds with children's themes, child-sized desks, and child-sized chairs. Decorative items, such as holiday decorations and household seasonal items that are intended only for display, with which children are not likely to interact, are generally not considered children's products, since they are intended to be used by adults.",
            "(2) Collectibles\u2014Adult collectibles may be distinguished from children's collectibles by themes that are inappropriate for children 12 years of age or younger, have features that preclude use by children during play, such as high cost, limited production, fragile features, display features (such as hooks or pedestals), and are not marketed alongside children's products (for example, in a children's department) in ways that make them indistinguishable from children's products. For example, collectible plush bears have high cost, are highly detailed, with fragile accessories, display cases, and platforms on which to pose and hold the bears. Children's bears have lower costs and simple accessories that can be handled without fear of damage to the product. Another example of collectible items includes model railways and trains made for hobbyists.",
            "(3) Jewelry\u2014Jewelry intended for children is generally sized, themed, and marketed to children. The following characteristics may cause a piece of jewelry to be considered a children's product: Size; very low cost; play value; childish themes on the jewelry; sale with children's products (such as a child's dress); sale with a child's book, a toy, or party favors; sale with children's cereal or snacks; sale at an entertainment or educational event attended primarily by children; sale in a store that contains mostly children's products; and sale in a vending machine. In addition, many aspects of an item's design and marketing are considered when determining the age of consumers for whom the product is intended and will be purchased including: Advertising; promotional materials; packaging graphics and text; dexterity requirements for wearing; appearance (coloring, textures, materials, design themes, licensing, and level of realism); and cost. These characteristics will help jewelry manufacturers and consumers determine whether a particular piece of jewelry is designed or intended primarily for children 12 years of age or younger.",
            "(4) DVDs, Video Games, and Computer Products\u2014Most computer products and electronic media, such as CDs, DVDs, and video games, are considered general use products. However, CDs and DVDs with encoded content that is intended for and marketed to children, such as children's movies, games, or educational software may be determined to be children's products. CPSC staff may consider ratings given by entertainment industries and software rating systems when making an age determination. In addition, electronic media players and devices that are embellished or decorated with childish themes that are intended to attract children 12 years of age or younger, are sized for children, or are marketed to appeal primarily to children, are not likely to fall under the general use category where children 12 years or younger likely would be the primary users of such devices. However, electronic devices such as CD players, DVD players, game consoles, book readers, digital media players, cell phones, digital assistant communication devices, and accessories to such devices that are intended mainly for children older than 12 years of age or adults are products for general use.",
            "(5) Art Materials\u2014Materials sized, decorated, and marketed to children 12 years of age or younger, such as crayons, finger paints, and modeling dough, would be considered children's products. Crafting kits and supplies that are not specifically marketed to children 12 years of age or younger likely would be considered products intended for general use. Consideration of the marketing and labeling of raw materials and art tools (such as modeling clay, paint, and paint brushes) may often be given high priority in an age determination because the appeal and utility of these raw materials has such a wide audience. If a distributor or retailer sells or rents a general use product in bulk (such as a raw art materials or art tools) through distribution channels that target children 12 years of age or younger in educational settings, such as schools, summer camps, or child care facilities, this type of a distribution strategy would not necessarily convert a general use product into a children's product. However, if the product is packaged in such a manner that either expressly states or implies with graphics, themes, labeling, or instructions that the product is designed or intended primarily for children 12 years of age or younger, then it may be considered a children's product if the required consideration of all four statutory factors supports that determination. The requirements of the Labeling of Hazardous Art Materials Act are similar to the labeling requirements of the FHSA, of which it is a part. Therefore, third party testing to LHAMA is not required. An art material designed or intended primarily for children 12 years of age or younger would have to be tested by a third party laboratory to demonstrate compliance with CPSIA, but it would not require third party testing and certification to the LHAMA requirements. For the same reasons, no general conformity certificate is required for general use art materials.",
            "(6) Books\u2014The content of a book can determine its intended audience. Children's books have themes, vocabularies, illustrations, and covers that match the interests and cognitive capabilities of children 12 years of age or younger. The age guidelines provided by librarians, education professionals, and publishers may be dispositive for determining the intended audience. Some children's books have a wide appeal to the general public, and in those instances, further analysis may be necessary to assess who the primary intended audience is based on consideration of relevant additional factors, such as product design, packaging, marketing, and sales data.",
            "(7) Science Equipment\u2014Microscopes, telescopes, and other scientific equipment that would be used by an adult, as well as a child, are considered general use products. Equipment that is intended by the manufacturer for use primarily by adults, although there may be use by children through such programs, is a general use product. Toy versions of such items are considered children's products. If a distributor or retailer sells or rents a general use product in bulk through distribution channels that target children 12 years of age or younger in educational settings, such as schools or summer camps, this type of a distribution strategy would not necessarily convert a general use product into a children's product. However, if the product is packaged in such a manner that either expressly states or implies with graphics, themes, labeling, or instructions that the product is designed or intended primarily for children 12 years of age or younger, then it may be considered a children's product if the required consideration of all four statutory factors supports that determination. Products mainly intended for use by the instructor would not be considered children's products. In general, scientific equipment that is specifically sized for children, such as protective gear, eyewear, gloves, or aprons and/or has childish themes or decorations and invites use by a child 12 years of age or younger or is marketed to appeal primarily to children is considered a children's product.",
            "(8) Sporting Goods and Recreational Equipment\u2014Sporting goods that are intended primarily for consumers older than 12 years of age are considered general use items. Sporting equipment, sized for adults, are general use items even though some children 12 years of age or younger will use them. Unless such items are specifically marketed to children 12 years of age or younger, or have extra features that make them more suitable for children 12 years of age or younger than for adults, they would be considered general use products. If children 12 years or younger would mainly use the product because it would be too small or inappropriate for older children to use, then it likely would be considered a children's product. Likewise, recreational equipment, such as roller blades, skateboards, bicycles, camping gear, and fitness equipment are considered general use products unless they are sized to fit children 12 years of age or younger and/or are decorated with childish features by the manufacturer.",
            "(9) Musical Instruments\u2014Musical instruments, including electronically-aided instruments suited for an adult musician, are general use products. Instruments intended primarily for children can be distinguished from adult instruments by their size and marketing themes. The Commission notes that if a distributor or retailer sells or rents in bulk, a general use musical instrument through distribution channels that target children 12 years of age or younger in educational settings, such as schools or summer camps, this type of a distribution strategy would not necessarily convert a general use product into a children's product. However, if the product is packaged in such a manner that either expressly states or implies with graphics, themes, labeling, or instructions that the product is designed or intended primarily for children 12 years of age or younger, then it may be considered a children's product if the required consideration of all four statutory factors supports that determination."

            "(a) Risk of injury. The Commission finds that unreasonable risks of injury from accidents are associated with matchbooks. These unreasonable risks, which this part 1202 is intended to reduce or eliminate, are:",
            "(1) Burn injuries, sustained by children and others, including mentally or physically impaired persons, who play with or otherwise improperly use bookmatches.",
            "(2) Burn injuries sustained by persons who use bookmatches that fragment or have delayed ignition.",
            "(3) Eye injuries sustained by persons who use bookmatches that fragment and cause particles from such matches to lodge in a person's eye.",
            "(4) Burn injuries sustained by persons who use bookmatches that, when struck, ignite the remaining matches in the matchbook.",
            "(5) Burn injuries sustained by persons from fires that have resulted from unexpected ignition of bookmatches with no deliberate action by the user.",
            "(6) Burn injuries that have been sustained by persons from fires that have been set by the afterglow of extinguished bookmatches.",
            "(b) Products subject to this standard. (1) The products subject to this standard are those kinds of manufactured ignition devices known as matchbooks. The matchbook consists of a group of bookmatches joined together and fastened within a cover. Although matchbooks are commonly referred to as paper matches or paper-stem matches to distinguish them from individual stick matches such as wooden stem matches packaged in boxes, all matchbooks, regardless of the materials of manufacture of the covers or of the bookmatches fastened within, are subject to this standard.",
            "(2) Matchbooks subject to this standard can be divided into two basic categories: Resale matchbooks and special reproduction matchbooks. Resale matchbooks can be subdivided into advertising and nonadvertising matchbooks. Nonadvertising matchbooks are generally sold by large chain stores, and constitute a small portion of the total resale matchbook volume. Resale matchbooks with advertising are generally given away by tobacco shops, drug stores, vending firms, and other mass distribution outlets. Special reproduction matchbooks, characterized by their distinctive and unique cover designs, are purchased and distributed for promotional purposes by hotels, restaurants, financial institutions, and other business enterprises, and are given free to users.",
            "(3) The Commission estimates that resale matchbooks accounted for almost 75 percent of the volume of matchbooks in 1975, or about 15 billion matchbooks, while special reproduction matchbooks accounted for just over 25 percent, or about 5.5 billion matchbooks.",
            "(c) Effects on utility, cost, and availability. (1) The Commission finds that the public need for ignition devices which are small, portable, and can be used to provide a source of fire, is substantial since such products meet basic requirements for a source of fire to ignite tobacco products, fires, candles, or other products, and are also used for miscellaneous other purposes such as providing short term illumination. Three types of products: Matchbooks, individual stick matches, and lighters, predominantly supply the source of fire to meet these requirements.",
            "(i) The Commission estimates that in 1976 U.S. consumers required approximately 645 billion such fire sources or \u201clights,\u201d as they are known, with almost 98 percent of this total required for tobacco products. In the aggregate, the requirements by U.S. consumers for a source of fire has been growing at an annual rate of approximately 3 percent. Matchbooks, the products regulated in this standard, are estimated to have supplied about 65 percent of the source of lights, lighters accounted for about 25 percent, and individual stick matches (primarily wooden-stem type) accounted for the remainder.",
            "(ii) The Commission also finds that matchbooks fulfill a need by institutions and business enterprises for a particular form of specialty advertising that is both relatively inexpensive and effective in reaching a specified audience or population segment with the advertiser's message. Various studies of matchbooks as a form of advertising have found that readership can average 3 to 15 times higher than average readership, listenership, and viewership figures from competing media such as magazines, newspapers, radio, and television, and that readership retention of the matchbook advertising message was extremely high, about 45 percent. In addition, matchbooks tend to be considerably less expensive than other forms of specialty advertising, including those competing advertising items such as address books, key cases, litterbags, and the like, which are themselves relatively inexpensive.",
            "(2) The Commission finds that the standard will have no adverse effects on the utility that consumers derive from matchbooks. To the extent that injuries and property damage associated with the use of matchbooks is reduced or eliminated as a result of this standard, the utility of matchbooks as a source of fire will be increased.",
            "(3) The Commission estimates that manufacturing cost increases as a direct or indirect effect of this standard will be modest for the industry as a whole. Such increases will tend to be concentrated in one-time costs to complete changeover to reverse friction, and in costs to establish and implement testing programs and certification procedures.",
            "(i) Because some 80-90 percent of the matchbooks produced annually are given free to consumers, there is not likely to be any direct cost impact on the consumer as a result of the standard. Some proportion of increased manufacturing costs will be passed on to the institutions and business enterprises that purchase matchbooks for promotional purposes. To the extent that increases in advertising and promotional costs may be reflected in higher prices for goods and services sold by these businesses, there may be indirect cost effects on consumers. If so, such impacts would likely be small, if not imperceptible.",
            "(ii) For the 12-20 percent of matchbooks that are purchases at retail by consumers, some proportion of any manufacturing cost increases may be passed on to the consumer. A resulting increase in retail prices for such matchbooks will be small, no more than a few cents per box of 50 matchbooks.",
            "(4) The Commission finds that the standard will not have impacts of significant magnitude on the availability of matchbooks. Although some institutions and business enterprises may reduce their matchbook purchases or eliminate them in response to any increased price of matchbooks, the large number of such purchasers, and the large volume purchased annually, are such that curtailment of purchases by some businesses is likely to have very small effects on the total number of matchbooks available to U.S. consumers.",
            "(d) Alternatives. (1) The Commission has considered other means of achieving the objective of the standard throughout the course of its development. Certain other more elaborate test requirements were considered and were shown to have the potential for severe adverse effects on competition and estimated to result in disruptions and dislocations of manufacturing and commercial practices. Therefore, having considered and rejected such other means of achieving the objective of the standard, the Commission has found none that would cause less disruption or dislocation of manufacturing and other commercial practices, consistent with the public health and safety than this standard.",
            "(2) Because of competition from substitute products such as inexpensive disposable butane lighters and because of other prevailing business and economic conditions, the industry manufacturing matchbooks has been in a state of contraction in recent years. This contraction, marked by the exit of some firms and by plant closings or consolidations, is likely to continue in the future; but this will neither be the result of, nor significantly accelerated by, effects of the standard. Currently, aggressive price and service competition prevails among firms vying for customer accounts. It is anticipated that this competition for sales may increase as an indirect effect of the standard. To the extent that this occurs, there may be some disruption or dislocation of manufacturing, sales, or distribution practices in certain matchbook product categories and market segments. Marginal firms and firms producing limited product categories or for limited market segments may be affected to a greater degree than multiproduct category or multimarket firms.",
            "(e) Conclusion. The Commission finds that this standard, including its effective date, is reasonably necessary to eliminate or reduce the unreasonable risks of injury associated with matchbooks and that the issuance of the standard is in the public interest."

            "(a) Scope and purpose. This part 1207 sets forth the consumer product safety standard issued by the Consumer Product Safety Commission for the manufacture and construction of slides for use in swimming pools. The requirements of this standard are designed to reduce or eliminate the unreasonable risks of death or injury associated with swimming pool slides. This standard also makes certain recommendations regarding the installation, maintenance, and intended use of swimming pool slides that supplement its mandatory requirements. This standard is applicable to all swimming pool slides manufactured after July 17, 1976. Paragraph (b) of this section sets forth the findings which the Commission is required to make by section 9(c) of the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2058(c)).",
            "(b) Findings. \n1\n (1) The Commission finds that unreasonable risks of death or injury from accidents are associated with swimming pool slides. These risks are (i) quadriplegia and paraplegia resulting from users (primarily adults using the swimming pool slide for the first time) sliding down the slide in a head first position and striking the bottom of the pool, (ii) leg fractures resulting from feet first entry, (iii) impact of sliders with other people in the pool, and (iv) falls from the slide ladder.",
            "(2) The Commission finds that the types or classes of products that are subject to this standard are those swimming pool slides manufactured, constructed, or imported for use in connection with all swimming pools, whether in-ground, on-ground, or above-ground, regardless of the materials of manufacture or structural characteristics of the slides. It is estimated that 350,000 of these slides are currently in service and that each year the number of slides in use may increase by 5 to 10 percent.",
            "(3) The Commission finds that the public uses swimming pool slides in recreation at both public and private swimming pools, and it is estimated that 75% of these slides are located at residential pools. It is anticipated that public demand for the products will decline slightly for a time following issuance of this standard as a result of consumer awareness of hazards associated with the product caused by the mandatory signs placed on the slides and as a result of recommendations regarding the installation and intended use of the products. The decline in demand is expected to be short-term. It is anticipated that the utility of the slides as a recreational device will be increased to the extent that injury or death associated with the use of the product is eliminated or reduced.",
            "(4) The Commission also finds that manufacturing cost increases as a direct result of this standard and promotional cost increases as an indirect result of this standard are expected to be modest for the industry as a whole. Any resulting increase in the cost of slides to consumers attributable directly or indirectly to the requirements of this standard will be small. No adverse effect on the availability of the product to consumers is expected.",
            "(5) The Commission has considered other means of achieving the objective of the standard, but has found none that would have fewer adverse effects on competition or that would cause less disruption or dislocation of manufacturing and other commercial practices, consistent with the public health and safety.",
            "(6) The Commission also finds that this standard, including its effective date, is reasonably necessary to eliminate or reduce the unreasonable risks of injury associated with swimming pool slides and that promulgation of the standard is in the public interest."

            "(iv) Fastener requirements. Ladder treads shall be attached to the ladder rails in such a manner that continued intended use or reasonably foreseeable abuse shall not cause any fastener to loosen, crack, or break. All attachment methods that are used to hold the ladder tread to the ladder rails shall be permanent and tamperproof. If fasteners are used for the tread-rail attachment, the number and placement of such fasteners shall not cause a failure of the tread under the ladder loading conditions specified in this paragraph (c)(3).",

            "(4) Attachment and strength of handrails. Handrails and their fasteners shall withstand allowable shear, bending, and cyclical loading in intended use and reasonably foreseeable abuse. All fasteners for handrail connections shall be vibrationproof, selflocking, and tamperproof. Threaded fasteners shall be capable of withstanding a 1-foot-pound (1,356-newton meter) back-off torque.",
            "(i) Sockets performance test. If handrail sockets are used, the handrail end shall be permanently fixed in the socket so that it cannot be pulled out or bent at the socket by a moment of 233 foot-pounds (316 newton-meters) applied clockwise around point A in figure E. The socket shall not permanently deform under the maximum applied loads.",
            "(ii) Side forces. If the handrail is in a socket or attached to the side of the slide runway rail, the attachment methods must be capable of withstanding all shear and bending forces induced by a 172-foot-pound (233-newton-meter) moment counterclockwise around point A in figure F.",
            "(iii) Performance tests\u2014(A) Strength for climbing and falls. (1) Attach a pull loop to point C of the upper handrail (figure E). Point C is the point where a perpendicular to the axis of the handrail passes through point A, the socket, or other attachment point. Attach a stranded steel cable or wire rope to point C. All cables and ropes shall have at least a 1,000-pound (4,448-newton) tensile capacity. Attach a 162-pound (73.5-kg) weight to this cable at least 4 feet (1.22 meters) below point C. Observe any permanent deformation or bending on the hand-rail at point A. If none exists, the handrail passes this performance test.",
            "(2) Lift the weight one foot (30.48 cm) from its maximum static position and drop it. Observe any permanent deformation of the handrail or its attachments at point A. If each handrail will still support the 162-pound (73.5-kg) weight for a period of 15 minutes and has not been bent more than 45\u00b0 from its original direction, it passes this performance test.",
            "(B) Transition handrail strength. Rotate the assembled slide into the horizontal position on its side on a loading dock or other platform. Move the slide into such a position that the entire handrail assembly overhangs the platform and level the slide. Fasten the slide firmly in this position and attach a 115-pound (52.2-kg) weight to point D, as shown in figure F, and check for any visible permanent deformation of the handrail at point A. If none exists, the handrails pass this performance test.",
            "(e) Lubrication. Swimming pool slides shall either be equipped with a method of lubrication (for example, water) or have a similar coefficient of friction so that the slider has a smooth, continuous slide. If water is used, the nozzles, piping, or hoses that deliver water to the runway shall be recessed or designed in such a fashion as not to interfere with a slider's progress down the slide or create tripping hazards on the slide.",
            "(f) Runways\u2014(1) Curvature. Slide runway curvature between the front and rear support legs of the slide shall be consistent with maintaining the slider safely on the slide during intended use and reasonably foreseeable abuse.",
            "(2) Dynamic equilibrium. (i) Swimming pool slide runways, whether straight or curved, shall be designed as \u201cbalanced curves.\u201d On a balanced curve, the test fixture discussed in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section shall stay on a trajectory that keeps it within a distance of \u00b141 percent of the runway width to the runway centerline at all points along the runway without contacting the runway rails.",
            "(ii) Performance test\u2014(A) Direct measurement. Build a wooden pallet no larger than 5 by 5 inches (12.7 \u00d7 12.7 cm), as shown in figure G. Securely attach a lead rod or bar on the pallet. Size the bar so that the weight-to-area ratio of the assembly is 1.30\u00b10.05 lbs./sq. in. (8,960\u00b1340 newtons/sq. meter) and the pallet does not tip over when in motion. Attach a felt pen or other suitable marking device to the pallet assembly as shown in figure G to mark the slide during descent.",
            "(B) Test. Lubricate the slide in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Center the pallet at the top of the slide runway and release. Observe the pallet's descent and note if it touches the slide's side rails. If it touches, check alignment and installation again. With water off and the slide dry, center the pallet at the top of the runway and release. Measure the distance from the felt pen marked line to the centerline of the runway. If within \u00b141 percent of the width measured from the centerline along the entire path and if the pallet does not contact the runway rails, the slide is dynamically balanced and passes this performance test.",
            "(3) Runway side rails. Swimming pool slide runways shall have permanent runway side rails of at least 2 inches (5.08 cm) and height to prevent lateral discharge of the slider off the slide under intended use and reasonably foreseeable abuse.",
            "(4) Runway side-rail heights. Runway side-rail heights shall be designed as a function of the maximum slide-slope angle (as shown in figure H). Table 2 that follows shows side-rail height versus maximum slide-slope angle. If the maximum slide-slope angle is not shown in table 2, the next higher side-rail height must be used. Maximum slide-slope angles shall not exceed 75\u00b0. (See figure H.)",
            "(5) Slide geometry. Swimming pool slide runways shall have a smooth transition section and have geometry such that the path of the center of gravity of the slider is not more than \u00b110\u00b0 from the horizontal at the center of gravity's exit off the slide and such that the slider's angle of attack (\u03b1), shown in figure I and defined below, shall be at least + 15\u00b0 when the slider's feet leave the slide. (See figure I.)",
            "(i) Performance tests. Measurement of the 50th-percentile adult male (71\u00b12 inches and 162\u00b15 pounds, 180.34\u00b15.08 cm and 73.5\u00b12.3 kg) \n1\n slider's angle of attack shall be made using any of the following methods or their equivalent:",
            "(A) Motion picture cameras (36 frames per second or more).",
            "(B) Still cameras with strobe lights and reflectors on the head and hip of the slider.",
            "(C) Still cameras with rotating shutters and lights on the head and hip of the slider.",
            "(D) Video tape recorder.",
            "(ii) Measurements shall be made from the still water level as the horizontal. The path angle shall be determined by measuring the angle between a tangent to the path of the center of gravity (line X) and the horizontal taken through the center of gravity (line Y). At least five consecutive runs with the same subject shall be made in order that an average may be computed. \n2\n Angle of attack shall be taken as the angle between the slider's longitudinal axis (Z) and the tangent to the path of his center of gravity (X). The slider's longitudinal axis shall be located by the vertical line that passes through his center of gravity when he stands erect. The slider shall wear usual swimming attire. The angle-of-attack measurement shall be made after the slider's feet have cleared the slide, the distance between the end of the slide and his feet being less than 8 inches (20.3 cm). The slider's descent must be headfirst, prone, belly-down, and with arms extended in front. Except when starting, the slider shall not augment the slide trip by forcibly reacting with the slide through the use of his hands, arms, feet and/or legs. The slider's starting reactions with the slide shall be only as strong as necessary to start him moving. If the average angle of attack measured and computed in the above manner is equal to or greater than + 15\u00b0, the slide passes this performance test.",
            "(6) Runway exit lips. All runway exit lips of swimming pool slides shall be smoothly faired into the runway surface with a radius of curvature at the exit lip of the slide of at least 2\n1/4 inches (5.72 cm) (see figure J).",
            "(7) Runway exit vertical angle. The angle of the runway at exit of the slide () shall be \u22123 to \u221211 degrees from the horizontal as shown in figure J.",
            "(8)(i) Runway exit ramp lateral curvature and exit lip horizontal angle. No net lateral forces on the slider shall exist in that portion of the runway exit ramp beyond the forward support points of the slide. All slides shall be designed and constructed so that the exit lip of the slide is level at all points along the width of the runway at the runway exit lip line drawn at the point where the lip curvature shown in figure J is tangent to the runway. The slide shall be designed so that any side forces on the user induced by prior lateral curvature will be reduced to zero upon exit from the slide runway.",
            "(ii) Performance tests. Those tests described in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section are also applicable to paragraph (f)(8) of this section, and the path of the test fixture must be parallel to the centerline of the slide at the exit lip (within 5\u00b0) and not touching the side rails of the runway.",
            "(9) Strength of slide runways and supports\u2014(i) Static loads. A properly assembled and installed slide runway shall be capable of supporting a static load of at least 350 pounds (1,557 newtons) applied normal to the runway over an area of no more than 20 square inches (129.03 square cm) at any point along its length or width.",
            "(ii) Dynamic loading. Properly assembled and installed slide runways shall be capable of supporting, without structural failure except as defined in paragraph (f)(9)(iii)(B)(3) of this section, a dynamic load of at least 450 foot-pounds (610.2 newton-meters) dropped on an area of 20 square inches (129.03 square cm) at the midpoints of the upper runway platform and the lower runway exit ramp.",
            "(iii) Performance tests\u2014(A) Static loads. Assemble and install a slide according to the manufacturer's instructions. Prepare a 20-square-inch (129.03 square cm) load-bearing pallet according to figure K. Place the loaded pallet on the upper slide platform, positioned between the runway rails, until the scale on the hoist line reads between 0 and 10 pounds (0 and 44.48 newtons). Keep the pallet in this position for 10 minutes. Remove the loaded pallet and observe the runway for any significant structural failure such as permanent deformations or cracks. If there are none, the slide passes the test. Repeat the same test on the lower runway exit ramp.",
            "(B) Dynamic loads. (1) Assemble and install a slide according to the manufacturer's instructions. Use the hardwood load pallet shown in figure K and set it up under dynamic load guides fabricated as shown in figure L, or an equivalent impact-testing machine.",
            "(2) Fabricate a 45-pound (20.4-kg) billet of 4.900\u00b10.005-inch (12.45\u00b1.01 cm) steel rod as shown in figure M, or equivalent, and load into the pipe above the trigger slot. The length of the pipe from the trigger slot to the impact pallet shall be 10.0\u00b10.1 feet (3.05 meters\u00b13.05 cm).",
            "(3) Drop the billet onto the pallet and observe the slide for any permanent deformations or cracks. If the slide runway can still support a static load of 350 pounds (1,557 newtons) on the pallet without further crack propagation, it passes this test.",
            "(4) Perform the test on the entrance and exit platforms of the slide runway."

            "(ii) 7.12.1. Assemble the bassinet/cradle base/stand only, in accordance with manufacturer's instructions in one of the manufacturer's recommended use positions. If the base/stand does not remain in the use position when the bassinet bed is not locked onto it, the product meets the requirements of 6.10.1.",
            "(iii) 7.12.2. Place the base/stand and the inclinometer on a flat level horizontal surface (0 \u00b1\u22120.5\u00b0) to establish a test plane. Zero the inclinometer.",
            "(iv) 7.12.3. Remove the mattress pad from the bassinet bed.",
            "(v) 7.12.4. Place the bassinet bed on the base/stand in the intended use orientation without engaging any latch or lock mechanism between the base/stand and the bassinet bed. If the bed automatically engages to the base/stand do not disengage the lock/latch. If the bassinet bed can rest on the base/stand in its intended use orientation in one or more lateral unlocked position (Figure 24), the unit shall be evaluated in the lateral position most likely to fail the requirements specified in 6.10.",
            "(vi) Figure 24: Bassinet Bed Resting on Stand, Showing Possible Alternate Lateral Positions.",
            "(vii) 7.12.4.1. If the base/stand supports the bassinet bed in any unlocked position, place the inclinometer on the mattress support at the approximate center of the mattress support. Care should be taken to avoid seams, snap fasteners, or other items that may affect the measurement reading. Record the angle measurement.",
            "(viii) 7.12.4.2. If the base/stand supports the bassinet bed and the angle of the mattress support surface measured in 7.12.4.1 is less than 20 degrees from a horizontal plane, evaluate whether the bassinet has a false latch/lock visual indicator per 6.10.4.",
            "(ix) 7.12.4.3. If the base/stand supports the bassinet bed, and the angle of the mattress support surface measured in 7.12.4.1 is less than 20 degrees from a horizontal plane, and the bassinet does not contain a false latch/lock visual indicator, test the unit in accordance with sections 7.4.2 through 7.4.7.",
            "(x) 7.12.5. Repeat 7.12.2 through 7.12.4 for all of the manufacturer's base/stand recommended positions and use modes.",
            "(xi) 7.12.6. Repeat 7.12.4 through 7.12.5 with the bassinet bed rotated 180 degrees from the manufacturers recommended use orientation, if the base/stand supports the bassinet bed in this orientation.",
            "(A) Rationale. (1) This test requirement addresses fatal and nonfatal incidents involving bassinet beds that tipped over or fell off their base/stand when they were not properly locked/latched to their base/stand or the latch failed to engage as intended. Products that appear to be in an intended use position when the lock or latch is not properly engaged can create a false sense of security by appearing to be stable. Unsecured or misaligned lock/latch systems are a hidden hazard because they are not easily seen by consumers due to being located beneath the bassinet or covered by decorative skirts. In addition, consumers will avoid activating lock/latch mechanisms for numerous reasons if a bassinet bed appears stable when placed on a stand/base. Because of these foreseeable use conditions, this requirement has been added to ensure that bassinets with a removable bassinet bed feature will be inherently stable or it is obvious that they are not properly secured.",
            "(2) 6.10 allows bassinet bed designs that:",
            "(i) Cannot be supported by the base/stand in an unlocked configuration,",
            "(ii) Automatically lock and cannot be placed in an unlocked position on the base/stand,",
            "(iii) Are clearly and obviously unstable when the lock/latch is misaligned or unused,",
            "(iv) Provide a visual warning to consumers when the product is not properly locked onto the base/stand, or",
            "(v) Have lock/latch mechanisms that are not necessary to provide needed stability.",

Even when the seller, manufacturer, or distributor modifies a pre-assembled product by adjusting to size, attaching the top rail or bottom rail, or tying cords to secure the bottom rail, the product is still considered stock. Online sales of the product or the size of the order such as multi-family housing do not make the product a non-stock product. These examples are provided in ANSI/WCMA A100.1\u20142018 to clarify that as long as the product is \u201csubstantially fabricated\u201d prior to distribution in commerce, subsequent changes to the product do not change its categorization.",

            "(5) Cord retraction device has the same meaning as defined in section 3, definition 2.08, of ANSI/WCMA A100.1\u20142018, as a passive device which winds and gathers cords when tension is no longer applied by the user.",
            "(6) Rigid cord shroud is a cord shroud that is constructed of inflexible material, rendering the cord inaccessible as defined in Appendix C of ANSI/WCMA A100.1\u20142018, to prevent a child from accessing a window covering cord.",
            "(7) Retractable cord is a cord that extends when pulled by a user, and fully retracts when the user releases the cord, rendering the cord inaccessible as defined in Appendix C of ANSI/WCMA A100.1\u20142018.",

            "(a) General. Section 9(f) of the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2058(f)) requires the Commission to make findings concerning the following topics and to include the findings in the rule.",
            "(b) Degree and nature of the risk of injury. (1) Operating cords on custom window coverings present an unreasonable risk of strangulation, including death and serious injury, to children 8 years old and younger. If children can access a window covering cord that is longer than 8 inches, children can wrap the cord around their neck, or insert their head into a loop formed by the cord and strangle. Strangulation can lead to serious injuries with permanent debilitating outcomes or death.",
            "(2) Strangulation deaths and injuries on window covering cords are a \u201chidden hazard\u201d because consumers do not understand or appreciate the hazard, or how quickly and silently strangulation occurs. Because young children may be left unsupervised for a few minutes or more in a room that is considered safe, such as a bedroom or family room, adult supervision is unlikely to eliminate or reduce the hazard. Children can wrap the cord around their neck, insert their head into a cord loop and get injured or die silently in a few minutes in any room, with or without supervision.",
            "(3) Safety devices such as cord cleats and tension devices are unlikely to be effective to eliminate or substantially reduce the hazard. Cord cleats, for example, need to be attached on the wall and caregivers must wrap the cord around the cleat each and every time the window covering is raised or lowered. As incident data show, children can still access and become entangled in cords by climbing on furniture. Tension devices also need to be attached on the wall or windowsill, which may not occur (and may not be permitted in rental homes); even if properly installed, depending on how taut the cord loop is, it can still allow a child's head to enter the opening as observed in the incident data.",
            "(4) A user research study found a lack of awareness on cord entanglement among caregivers; lack of awareness of the speed and mechanism of the injury; difficulty using and installing safety devices as primary reasons for not using them; and inability to recognize the purpose of the safety devices provided with window coverings. Warning labels are not likely to be effective because consumers are less likely to look for and read safety information about the products that they use frequently and are familiar with. Many of the children at risk of strangulation, those 8 years old and younger, cannot read or appreciate warning labels. Most of the window covering units involved in strangulation incidents had the permanent warning label on the product. Even well-designed warning labels will have limited effectiveness in communicating the hazard on this type of product.",
            "(5) Every custom product sold with an accessible operating cord presents a hidden hazard to young children and can remain a hazard in the household for one to two decades or longer. Some consumers may believe that because they do not currently have young children living with them or visiting them, accessible operating cords on window coverings are not a safety hazard. However, window coverings last a long time, family circumstances change, and when homes are sold or new renters move in, the existing window coverings, if they are functional, usually remain installed and could be hazardous to new occupants with young children.",
            "(6) Window coverings that comply with the operating cord requirements for stock window covering requirements in section 4.3.1 of ANSI/WCMA A100.1\u20142018 (incorporated by reference, see \u00a7 1260.5) adequately address the strangulation hazard, by not allowing hazardous cords on the product by design, and therefore do not rely on consumer action. CPSC finds that all of the operating cord incidents it identified as involving custom window coverings likely would have been prevented if the requirements in section 4.3.1 of ANSI/WCMA A100.1\u20142018 were in effect and covered the incident products.",
            "(7) CPSC databases contain incident data showing a total of 209 reported fatal and nonfatal strangulations on window coverings among children eight years and younger, from January 2009 through December 2021. Nearly 48 percent of the reported incidents were fatal (100 of 209). Sixteen of the surviving victims required hospitalization, and six survived a hypoxic-ischemic episode or were pulseless and in full cardiac arrest when found, suffered severe neurological sequalae ranging from loss of memory to a long-term or permanent vegetative state requiring tracheotomy and gastrointestinal tube feeding. One victim remained hospitalized for 72 days, was released with 75 percent permanent brain damage, and is confined to a bed.",
            "(8) Based on CPSC's Injury Cost Model, approximately 7.6 medically treated nonfatal injuries to children 8 years and younger occurred annually in the United States from 2009 through 2021. Based on National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) data and a separate study of child strangulations, a minimum of approximately 6.8 fatal strangulations related to window covering operating cords (excluding inner cords and lifting loops) occurred per year in the United States among children under eight years old from 2009-2020.",
            "(c) Number of consumer products subject to the rule. Approximately 145 million corded custom window coverings were in use in the United States in 2020. About 25 million custom window coverings were shipped in the U.S. in 2020, and about 15.9 million of these were corded custom window coverings.",
            "(d) The public need for custom window coverings and the effects of the rule on their utility, cost, and availability. (1) Consumers commonly use window coverings in their homes to control light coming in through windows, for privacy, and for decoration. The window covering market is divided into stock and custom products. The final rule addresses hazards associated with custom window coverings, which present the same risk of strangulation as stock window coverings, but custom window coverings allow consumers to choose from a wider variety of materials, colors, operating systems, or sizes, than stock products.",
            "(2) The Commission does not expect the final rule to have a substantial effect on the utility or availability of custom window coverings, and the impact on cost depends on the product type. The Commission considered whether some consumers, such as the elderly and disabled, or those with windows in hard-to-reach locations, would experience a loss of utility from the removal of accessible operating cords from custom window coverings. The final rule mitigates any potential loss in utility by including several methods to make operating cords safer while still providing ease of use, including rigid cord shrouds, retractable cords, and loop cord and bead restraining devices, to assist consumers to raise and lower custom window coverings. Additionally, consumers can choose to use a remote-controlled operating system, or other tools, such as a pole, to operate the window covering.",
            "(3) Retail prices of custom window coverings vary substantially. The least expensive units for an average size window retail for less than $40, while some more expensive units may retail for several thousand dollars. Custom window covering prices may increase to reflect the added cost of modifying or redesigning products to comply with the final rule. If the costs associated with redesigning or modifying a custom window covering to comply with the standard results in the manufacturer discontinuing that model, there would be some loss in availability of that type.",
            "(4) Although prices of stock window coverings have increased since ANSI/WCMA A100.1\u20142018 went into effect in 2018, sales of stock products remain consistent. For custom products, which have higher prices on average, consumers very well may be willing to pay more for a safer window covering without affecting sales, similar to stock window coverings. The regulatory analysis in the final rule states that the estimated net cost increase per household to replace all custom window products in a home to be as low as $24 for less expensive products, representing only a 5% increase in cost. Such cost increase is nominal to prevent the hidden strangulation hazard to children on window coverings for the 10 years custom window coverings are likely to be used.",
            "(e) Other means to achieve the objective of the rule, while minimizing adverse effects on competition and manufacturing. (1) The Commission considered alternatives to achieving the rule's objective of reducing the unreasonable risks to children of injury and death associated with operating cords on custom window coverings. For example, the Commission considered relying on compliance with the voluntary standard and education campaigns rather than issuing a mandatory rule for operating cords on custom window coverings. This is the approach CPSC has relied on to date, and it would have minimal costs; however, it is unlikely to further reduce the risk of injury from operating cords on custom window coverings.",
            "(2) Similarly, the Commission considered narrowing the scope of the rule to address only the hazards associated with operating cords on custom vertical blinds, curtains, and drapes, because cords are not critical to the operation of these products. Narrowing the rule to these three product types would lessen the cost impact and make it unlikely that any particular product type and/or size would be eliminated, and costs would be near $0 because using plastic rods for operation is very similar to cords in cost. However, only 3 of the 36 custom product incidents (all are fatalities) were associated with vertical blinds, and there were no curtain or drape incidents where the stock/custom classification could be determined. This option would not result in an effective reduction in injuries and deaths.",
            "(3) Other alternatives the Commission considered include: adopting the Canadian standard for window covering cords, which would increase the costs to comply with the rule with no additional benefits, and adopting a draft revised version of the voluntary standard, which the Commission staff has determined is inadequate to address the risk of injury because the revised standard would still allow accessible cords to remain available for sale to consumers.",
            "(4) The Commission also considered setting a later effective date. Based on the record before the Commission, including the severity of the strangulation hazard to children, the advanced state of compliance with similar requirements for stock window coverings in the United States and for stock and custom window coverings in Canada, and the long pendency of this proceeding, the final rule provides an effective date that is 180 days after publication of the final rule, as proposed.",
            "(f) Unreasonable risk. (1) Based on CPSC's Injury Cost Model, about 185 medically treated nonfatal injuries are predicted to have occurred annually from 2009 through 2020, involving children eight years and younger. Based on a review of National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS data) and a separate study of child strangulations, a minimum of 8.1 fatal strangulations related to window covering cords occurred per year in the United States among children under five years old from 2009-2020. Based on reviews of CPSC databases, we found reports of a total of 209 reported fatal and nonfatal strangulations on window coverings among children eight years and younger, from January 2009 through December 2021. Nearly 48 percent were fatal incident reports (100 of 209), while the remaining were near-miss nonfatal incidents.",
            "(2) The Commission estimates that the rule would result in aggregate benefits of about $31.6 million annually due to a reduction in deaths and injuries caused by custom window coverings. Of the potential modifications for which staff was able to estimate the potential cost, the lowest costs were about $2.18 per unit, although costs for some units are likely $0. Effective performance requirements for operating cords on window coverings are well known and already utilized for lower-priced stock window coverings. Technologies to address hazardous window covering cords are also known and utilized on stock products.",
            "(3) The determination of whether a consumer product safety rule is reasonably necessary to reduce an unreasonable risk of injury involves balancing the degree and nature of the risk of injury addressed by the rule against the probable effect of the rule on the utility, cost, or availability of the product. The Commission does not expect the final rule to have a substantial effect on the utility or availability of custom window coverings. The rule may impact the cost of custom window coverings, but consumers already pay more for custom window coverings, and are likely willing to pay more for safer products.",
            "(4) ANSI/WCMA-2018 eliminated the strangulation hazard on stock window coverings, which did not negatively impact sales of stock products; sales increased and cordless technologies became well-developed. The final rule will extend the requirements for stock products to custom window coverings. The Commission expects that the custom window covering market will absorb this cost, just as seen in the stock window covering market. This fact is also observed in the Canadian window covering market after Canada implemented a rule that eliminates hazardous cords on all window covering products. Staff identified no evidence from the Canadian market of a significant reduction in consumer choice as a result of their rule. Rather, the Canadian market has reacted with cost-effective substitutes and redesigned products.",
            "(5) Weighing the possibility of increased costs for custom window coverings with the continuing deaths and injuries to young children, the Commission concludes that custom window coverings with hazardous operating cords pose an unreasonable risk of injury and death and finds that the final rule is reasonably necessary to reduce that unreasonable risk of injury and death.",
            "(6) The Commission also finds that an effective date of 180 days after publication is reasonably necessary to address the unreasonable risk of strangulation from operating cords on custom window coverings. Section 9(g)(1) of the CPSA (15 U.S.C. 2058(g)(1)) sets a presumptive maximum effective date of 180 days after publication of the rule. To extend this period, the Commission must find good cause that doing so is within the public interest. When balancing the risk of severe harm and death to young children over the entire service life of noncompliant window coverings, against the possibility that some styles of custom window coverings may be less available during a transition period and stock products or other custom styles might need to be used instead, the Commission finds that the public interest is better served by protecting the safety of children and families.",
            "(g) Public interest. The final rule is intended to address an unreasonable risk of injury and death posed by hazardous operating cords on custom window coverings. Adherence to the requirements of the final rule will significantly reduce or eliminate a hidden hazard, strangulation deaths and injuries to children 8 years old and younger, without major disruption to industry or consumers; thus, the Commission finds that promulgation of the rule is in the public interest.",
            "(h) Voluntary standards. The Commission is aware of one national voluntary standard, ANSI/WCMA A100.1\u20142018, as well as European, Australian, and Canadian standards. Among these, the Commission considers the Canadian standard to be the most stringent because it applies to all window coverings. ANSI/WCMA A100.1\u20142018 contains adequate performance requirements to address the risk of strangulation on inner cords for both stock and custom window coverings and contains adequate requirements to address the risk of injury on operating cords for stock products. The Commission also finds that custom window coverings substantially comply with the voluntary standard. However, the Commission finds that operating cord requirements for custom window coverings in ANSI/WCMA A100.1\u20142018 are inadequate to address the risk of injury, because the voluntary standard allows accessible and hazardous operating cords to be present on custom products. Thus, the Commission finds that compliance with an existing voluntary standard is not likely to result in the elimination or adequate reduction of the risk of injury presented by custom window coverings.",
            "(i) Relationship of benefits to costs. (1) The aggregate benefits of the rule are conservatively estimated to be about $23 million annually with the base value of statistical life (VSL); and the lowest cost of the rule is estimated to be about $54.4 million annually. Recent studies suggest that the VSL for children could be higher than that for adults. In other words, consumers might be willing to pay more to reduce the risk of premature death of children than to reduce the risk of premature death of adults. A review of the literature conducted for the CPSC suggested that the VSL for children could exceed that of adults by a factor of 1.2 to 3, with a midpoint of around 2 (Industrial Economics, Incorporated (IEc), 2018). \u201cMemorandum to CPSC: Valuing Reductions in Fatal Risks to Children.\u201d Cambridge, MA (available at: https://www.cpsc.gov/s3fs-public/VSL_Children_Report_FINAL_20180103.pdf). The Commission received positive comment on increasing the VSL for children by a factor of 3. Staff provided a sensitivity analysis for the final rule demonstrating how the ratio of costs and benefits change based on several variables, including a higher VSL for children. When staff increased the VSL by a factor of 3 for children (value of $31.5 million), the benefits of the rule exceed costs by approximately $14.3 million.",
            "(2) Staff's benefits and costs analysis also highlights unquantified benefits regarding the emotional distress of caregivers that could also be reduced by the final rule. This benefit is not directly accounted for in the primary VSL estimate of $10.5 million. The value of the shock or perceived guilt related to a caregiver's inattentiveness could be significant, as it could result in large reductions to physical wellbeing or income loss.",
            "(3) To determine how the final rule impacts consumers, staff converted costs and benefits of the rule into a calculated net cost per household, based on the data point that the average detached, single-family household has 12 window coverings. This analysis translates into a net cost of the final rule of $1.97 for metal or vinyl horizontal blinds. Using the assumption of 12 window coverings per household, this equates to a net cost of the rule (above the benefits provided) of $23.67 per household every time a household updates their custom window coverings, about once every 10 years. For metal or vinyl horizontal blinds, $23.67 is slightly more than 5 percent of the total cost of $448.32 that a household would spend to update their window coverings.",
            "(4) We note that economies of scale associated with the voluntary standard for stock product operating cords, and the Canadian standard, may have reduced costs associated with cordless components since Commission staff developed the bases for their cost estimates as early as 2016. Additionally, custom window coverings have a longer product life, which increases the benefit of improving safety beyond the levels Commission staff determined for both stock and customer window coverings.",
            "(5) Based on this analysis, the Commission finds that the benefits expected from the rule bear a reasonable relationship to the anticipated costs of the rule.",
            "(j) Least burdensome requirement that would adequately reduce the risk of injury. (1) The Commission considered less-burdensome alternatives to the final rule, detailed in paragraph (e) of this section, but finds that none of these alternatives would adequately reduce the risk of injury.",
            "(2) The Commission considered relying on voluntary recalls, compliance with the voluntary standard, and education campaigns, rather than issuing a mandatory standard. These alternatives would have minimal costs but would be unlikely to reduce the risk of injury from custom window coverings that contain hazardous cords.",
            "(3) The Commission considered issuing a standard that applies only to certain types of window coverings such as vertical blinds. This would impose lower costs on manufacturers but is unlikely to adequately reduce the risk of injury because it would only address incidents associated with those types. Based on the custom product incident data, only 8.3 percent of the incidents involved vertical blinds and 22.2 percent involved faux wood/wood blinds. The Commission considered adopting the Canadian standard for window covering cords, which would increase the costs to comply with the rule with no additional benefits and/or providing a longer effective date. And the Commission considered adopting a 2022 draft revision of the voluntary standard but finds the requirements in the standard inadequate to address the risk of injury."

            "(a) General. Section 9(f) of the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2058(f)) requires the Commission to make findings concerning the following topics and to include the findings in the rule.",
            "(b) Degree and nature of the risk of injury. (1) The standard is designed to reduce the risk of death and injury associated with magnet ingestions. There were an estimated 26,600 magnet ingestions were treated in hospital EDs from January 1, 2010, through December 31, 2021. There were an estimated 5,000 magnet ingestions treated in U.S. hospital EDs between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2021, that involved in-scope identified subject magnet products, and an additional estimated 20,000 ED-treated magnet ingestions involving unidentified magnet products, which are likely to have involved subject magnet products. There were an estimated 2,500 ED-treated ingestions of magnets from identified magnet products in year 2021, higher than the majority of the preceding years, including 2018 through 2020. In this same period, January 1, 2010, through December 31, 2021, there were an estimated 286 CPSRMS-reported magnet ingestions involving identified subject magnet products and 76 CPSRMS-reported magnet ingestions involving unidentified subject magnet products. In addition, based on NEISS annual estimates from 2017-2021, ICM showed that there were an additional estimated 263 magnet ingestion injuries per year involving identified subject magnet products, which were treated in medical settings other than EDs (185 injuries treated outside of hospitals and 78 resulted in direct hospital admission).",
            "(2) The potential injuries when a child or teen ingests one or more hazardous magnets are serious. Health threats posed by hazardous magnet ingestion include pressure necrosis, volvulus, bowel obstruction, bleeding, fistulae, ischemia, inflammation, perforation, peritonitis, sepsis, ileus, ulceration, aspiration, and death, among others. These conditions can result from magnets attracting to each other through internal body tissue, or a single magnet attracting to a ferromagnetic object. CPSC is aware of serious injuries and several fatal magnet ingestion incidents that occurred in the United States, resulting from internal interaction of magnets.",
            "(c) Number of consumer products subject to the rule. The CPSC estimates that there are approximately 500,000 subject magnet products sold annually in the United States. However, to account for a range of sales estimates, staff provided information for sales ranging from 100,000 to 1 million units annually.",
            "(d) The need of the public for subject magnet products and the effects of the rule on their cost, availability, and utility. (1) Consumers use subject magnet products for entertainment, mental stimulation, stress relief, and jewelry. The rule requires subject magnet products to meet performance requirements regarding size or strength, but it does not restrict the design of products. As such, subject magnet products that meet the standard can continue to serve the purpose of amusement or jewelry for consumers. Magnets that comply with the performance requirements of the rule, such as non-separable magnets, larger magnets, weaker magnets, or non-permanent magnets, may be useful for amusement or jewelry. However, it is possible that there may be some negative effect on the utility of subject magnet products if compliant products function differently or do not include certain desired characteristics.",
            "(2) Retail prices of subject magnet products generally average under $20. CPSC has identified subject magnet products that comply with the rule, and the prices of compliant and non-compliant products are comparable.",
            "(3) If the costs associated with redesigning or modifying subject magnet products to comply with the rule results in manufacturers discontinuing products, there may be some loss in availability to consumers. However, this would be mitigated to the extent that compliant products meet the same consumer needs, and there are compliant products currently available for sale to consumers.",
            "(4) Manufacturers may sell complying products to mitigate costs. In addition to products that comply with the performance requirements, there are products that are not subject to the performance requirements. Products sold and/or distributed solely to school educators, researchers, professionals, and/or commercial or industrial users exclusively for educational, research, professional, commercial, and/or industrial purposes are not subject magnet products, and firms may continue to manufacture, sell, and distribute such magnet products.",
            "(e) Other means to achieve the objective of the rule while minimizing adverse effects on competition, manufacturing, and commercial practices. The Commission considered other alternatives that might reduce the impact of a rule on small businesses, including promulgating an alternative set of requirements for the flux index or size of the magnets; requiring safer packaging; requiring warnings on the packaging and promotional materials; requiring aversive agents on magnets; relying on voluntary standards; delaying the effective date; and taking no action. Although each of the alternative actions would have lower costs and less impact on small business, none is likely to significantly reduce the injuries associated with ingestion of magnets from subject magnet products.",
            "(f) Unreasonable risk. (1) Incident data indicate that there were an estimated 25,000 magnet ingestions treated in U.S. hospital EDs from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2021, which involved in-scope magnet products. Of these estimated 25,000 ED-treated magnet ingestions, an estimated 5,000 involved in-scope identified subject magnet products, and an estimated 20,000 involved \u201cunidentified\u201d magnet product types that, based on incident data and factors considered by the Commission, are likely to be subject magnet products. During 2017 through 2021, based on the NEISS annual estimate of about 481 magnet injuries initially treated in hospital EDs involving in-scope identified magnets there were 320 injuries that were treated and released and 161 injuries that required hospitalization. Additionally, based on estimates from the ICM, 185 injuries were treated outside of hospitals annually and another 78 injuries resulted in direct hospital admission. These incidents indicate the frequency with which children and teens ingest magnets, and the need to address the magnet ingestion hazard.",
            "(2) The potential injuries when a person ingests one or more magnets are serious. Health threats posed by magnet ingestion include pressure necrosis, volvulus, bowel obstruction, bleeding, fistulae, ischemia, inflammation, perforation, peritonitis, sepsis, ileus, ulceration, aspiration, and death, among others. These conditions can result from magnets attracting to each other through internal body tissue, or a single magnet attracting to a ferromagnetic object. Magnet ingestion incidents commonly result in hospitalization, particularly when subject magnet products are ingested. The Commission is aware of serious injuries as well as five fatal magnet ingestion incidents that occurred in the United States between November 24, 2005, and January 5, 2021. Four of these incidents involved children 2 years old or younger, and all five victims died from injuries resulting from internal interaction of the magnets. Four of the five incidents identified the products as magnet sets, amusement products, or described them as having characteristics that are consistent with subject magnet products.",
            "(3) CPSC's trend analysis of the incident data indicates that magnet ingestions have significantly increased in recent years. In 2014, Commission issued a rule that applied to magnet sets, which are a subset of the subject magnet products addressed in this rule. The 2014 magnet sets rule took effect in April 2015 and remained in effect until it was vacated and remanded by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit Court in November 2016. Zen Magnets, LLC v. Consumer Prod. Safety Comm'n., 841 F.3d 1141 (10th Cir. 2016). ED-treated ingestions of magnets from subject magnet products continued to rise since the 2014 magnets set rule was vacated. A review of the annual estimates for ED-treated, magnet ingestions by year, from 2010 through 2021 showed that magnet ingestions are higher for the 2017 through 2021 period, than the previous periods, with more in-scope magnet ingestions in 2021 (2,500) than most of the preceding years, including 2018 through 2020. To assess these trends further, CPSC grouped the years in relation to the vacated 2014 magnet sets rule, using three separate periods. CPSC reviewed the magnet ingestions treated in U.S. hospital EDs for the periods 2010 through 2013 (years prior to the announcement of the 2014 magnet sets rule), 2014 through 2016 (years when the 2014 magnet sets rule was announced and in effect), and 2017 through 2021 (years after the magnet set rule was vacated). For 2010-2013, there were approximately 2,300 ED-treated magnet ingestion incidents per year; for 2014-2016, there were an approximately 1,300 ED-treated magnet ingestion incidents per year; for 2017-2021, there were approximately 2,400 ED-treated magnet ingestion incidents per year. Thus, during the period when the 2014 magnet sets rule was announced and in effect (2014-2016), magnet injury ingestion estimates are lowest by a significant margin, compared with the earlier and more recent periods. CPSRMS data also showed a similar decline in incidents for the period when the magnet sets rule was announced and in effect. CPSC's assessment of incident data, as well as other researchers' assessments of NEISS data, and national poison center data, all indicated that magnet ingestion cases significantly declined during the years when the 2014 magnet sets rule was announced and in effect, compared to the periods before and after the 2014 magnet sets rule.",
            "(4) For these reasons, the Commission finds that the rule is reasonably necessary to eliminate or reduce an unreasonable risk of injury associated with the product.",
            "(g) Public interest. This rule is intended to address an unreasonable risk of injury and death posed by magnet ingestions. The Commission finds that compliance with the requirements of the rule will significantly reduce magnet ingestion deaths and injuries in the future; thus, the Commission finds that promulgation of the rule is in the public interest.",
            "(h) Voluntary standards. (1) The Commission is aware of six relevant standards, four domestic and two international, that address the magnet ingestion hazard. One standard is mandatory, ASTM F963-17, Standard Consumer Safety Specification for Toy Safety (incorporated by reference at \u00a7\u00a7 1262.4 and 1250.2 of this chapter). The other voluntary standards include: ASTM F2923-20, Standard Specification for Consumer Product Safety for Children's Jewelry; ASTM F2999-19, Standard Consumer Safety Specification for Adult Jewelry; ASTM F3458-21, Standard Specification for Marketing, Packaging, and Labeling Adult Magnet Sets Containing Small, Loose, Powerful Magnets (with a Flux Index \u2265 50 kG\n2 mm\n2) (see \u00a7 1262.4 for the availability of ASTM standards from ASTM International); EN-71-1: 2014, Safety of Toys; Part 1: Mechanical and Physical Properties (available from EN European Standards; Krimicka 134, 318 00 Pilsen, Czech Republic, phone: 420 377 921 379; www.en-standard.eu); and ISO 8124-1: 2018, Safety of Toys\u2014Part 1: Safety Aspects Related to Mechanical and Physical Properties (available from International Organization for Standardization; Chemin de Blandonnet 8, CP 401-1214 Vernier, Geneva, Switzerland; phone: 41 22 749 01 11; www.iso.org).",
            "(2) The Commission finds that compliance with existing standards is not likely to result in the elimination or adequate reduction of the risk of injury associated with ingestion of subject magnet products.",
            "(i) Relationship of benefits to costs. (1) CPSC estimates that aggregate annual societal costs from ingestion injuries involving subject magnet products for 2017 through 2021 totaled $51.8 million, even when ingestion injuries involving unidentified magnet products are excluded. The expected costs of the rule include the lost value experienced by consumers who would no longer be able to purchase subject magnet products with loose or separable hazardous magnets, as well as the lost profits to firms that could not produce and sell non-complying products in the future. Estimates of consumer and producer surplus range from about $2 million to $3.5 million to about $20 million to $35 million, based on unit sales ranging from 100,000 to 1 million. If annual unit sales of non-complying subject magnet products are 500,000, expected aggregate benefits from the rule would total $51.8 million annually as noted above; costs (lost consumer and producer surplus) would range from $10 million to $17.5 million annually. Thus, the benefits of the rule would greatly exceed the costs.",
            "(2) If unidentified magnet products involved in ingestion injuries, which are also likely to be subject magnet products, are considered as well, average annual societal costs for 2017 through 2021 would increase by $167.9 million. A sensitivity analysis shows that adding even a relatively small portion of NEISS cases involving unidentified magnet products to the base case substantially increases the estimated gross benefits of the rule. Although CPSC's analysis of the data, the trends in NEISS, CPSRMS, and poison center-reported, magnet-related incidents support the conclusion that the unidentified magnet products generally involved magnets considered within the scope of the rule, because CPSC does not know precisely how many of these products would fall within the scope of this rule, CPSC has not included them in the primary benefit analysis. Instead, CPSC includes the benefits from unidentified magnet products in this final rule's sensitivity analysis to illustrate the theoretical upper bounds of benefits from this rule. Theoretically, including 100 percent of these societal costs with those estimated for identified subject magnet products ($51.8 million) could yield average annual societal costs of magnet ingestion injuries of $219.7 million for the period 2017 through 2021.",
            "(j) Least burdensome requirement that would adequately reduce the risk of injury. CPSC considered several less-burdensome alternatives to the rule.",
            "(1) One alternative is to take no regulatory action and, instead, rely on existing standards to address the magnet ingestion hazard. This alternative would reduce the burden associated with the rule by avoiding a mandatory standard, but it is unlikely to adequately address the magnet ingestion hazard due to the limited scope and requirements of existing standards and uncertainty regarding compliance with them.",
            "(2) Another alternative is a mandatory standard with less stringent requirements than the proposed rule, such as a higher flux index limit, or different requirements for certain shapes and sizes of magnets. This could reduce the burden associated with a rule by allowing firms to market a wider variety of products than under the rule. However, this alternative would reduce the safety benefits because allowing certain hazardous magnets in subject magnet products to remain on the market does not address the hazard such products pose.",
            "(3) Safety messaging is another alternative to the rule. This alternative would reduce the burdens associated with the rule because it would not require modifying or discontinuing subject magnet products, and the costs of such warnings and instructional information likely would be small. However, this alternative is not likely to adequately reduce the magnet ingestion hazard. Incident data shows children commonly access ingested magnets from sources that do not include the product packaging where warnings are provided. Incident data, behavioral and developmental factors, and other information indicate that children and caregivers commonly disregard safety messaging regarding the magnet ingestion hazard. Finally, this approach has not been effective at adequately reducing the hazard, to date.",
            "(4) Another alternative is to require special packaging to limit children's access to subject magnet products. Although this alternative would create some packaging costs, those costs likely would be lower than the costs of the rule because this alternative would allow subject magnet products to remain unchanged. However, this alternative is not likely to adequately reduce the risk of injury and death associated with magnet ingestions. Consumers are unlikely to repackage all magnets after each use, given the small size and large number of magnets in products, the potential to lose magnets, and consumers' underappreciation of the hazard. In addition, commercially reasonable packaging requirements would only prevent young children (typically, children under 5 years old) from accessing the product, not older children, or teens, who are involved in the majority of magnet ingestion incidents.",
            "(5) Another alternative is to require subject magnet products to be coated with aversive agents. This alternative would reduce the burden associated with the rule because it would allow firms to continue to sell subject magnet products and the costs of such coatings likely would be small. However, such requirements are not likely to adequately address the hazard because they do not address ingestions that occur when the first magnet is placed in the victim's mouth, before the aversive agent is detected, accidental ingestions, or children who are developmentally inclined to place objects in their mouths.",
            "(6) Another alternative is to provide a later effective date for the final rule. This may reduce the burdens associated with the rule by spreading them over a longer period, but it would also delay the safety benefits of the rule.",
            "(7) For these reasons, the Commission finds that the rule imposes the least burdensome requirement that prevents or adequately reduces the risk of injury associated with magnet ingestions."

            "(a) In this part 1301 the Consumer Product Safety Commission (Commission) declares that certain unstable refuse bins are banned hazardous products under sections 8 and 9 of the Consumer Product Safety Act (CPSA) (15 U.S.C. 2057 and 2058).",
            "(b) This ban applies to those refuse bins of metal construction that are being distributed in commerce on or after the effective date of this rule, which do not meet the criteria of \u00a7 1301.5 and which are produced or distributed for sale to, or for the personal use, consumption or enjoyment of consumers, in or around a permanent or temporary household or residence, a school, in recreation or otherwise. The Commission has found that (1) these refuse bins are being, or will be distributed in commerce; (2) they present an unreasonable risk of injury; and (3) no feasible consumer product safety standard under the CPSA would adequately protect the public from the unreasonable risk of injury associated with these products. The ban is applicable to those refuse bins having an internal volume one cubic yard or greater by actual measurement, which will tip over when subjected to either of the forces described in \u00a7 1301.7 and which are in commerce or being distributed in commerce on or after the effective date of the ban.",
            "(c) When such refuse bins are the subject of rental or lease transactions between owners of refuse bins or between refuse collection agencies and persons who make such refuse bins available for use by the public, such transactions are considered to be distributions in commerce and therefore come within the scope of this ban. Refuse collection agencies or owners of refuse bins who rent or lease refuse bins to persons who make them available for use by consumers are considered to be distributors; the persons to whom refuse bins are rented or leased are not considered to be distributors.",
            "(d) On or after the effective date of this rule it shall be unlawful to manufacture for sale, offer for sale, or distribute in commerce, the unstable refuse bins described in this rule.",
            "(e) This rule, effective November 13, 1981, is partially revoked and therefore does not apply to front-loading, straight-sided refuse bins without trunnion bars having an internal volume capacity of 1, 1\n1/2, or 2 cubic yards, of the following external dimensions:"

            "(a) Risk of injury. The Commission has studied 19 in-depth investigation reports of accidents associated with tip-over of unstable refuse bins. The 19 accidents, which involved 21 victims, resulted in 13 deaths. Of the 21 victims, 20 were children 10 years of age and under. Additionally, Commission records show three death certificates for victims, under 5 years of age, who were killed by refuse bins tipping over. Therefore, the Commission finds that unreasonable risks of injury or death from crushing due to tip-over are associated with certain unstable refuse bins having an internal volume one cubic yard or greater, which unreasonable risk this banning rule is designed to eliminate or reduce.",
            "(b) Products subject to this ban. (1) The Commission finds that the types of products subject to this ban are those manufactured metal receptacles known in the solid waste collection trade as containers, refuse bins, buckets, boxes or hoppers, with actual internal volumes of one cubic yard or greater, used for the storage and transportation of solid waste. They are fabricated in numerous sizes and configurations for use with rear, side, front, hoist and roll-off loaded trash collection trucks and are used by private firms and public agencies.",
            "(2) Although unstable refuse bins subject to this ban may be in various forms and shapes, the Commission's in-depth investigations into accidents associated with metal refuse containers indicate that most accidents have occurred with slant-sided metal refuse bins which are used by rear and side-loaded trucks. Therefore, the Commission bases its economic analysis of the potential impact of the ban upon the population of these bins. Certain refuse bins such as front loaded, roll-off, box and other types of large or broad based bins, because of their configuration, bulk and weight are likely to be inherently stable and are therefore not included in the population of potentially unstable bins studied in this economic analysis.",
            "(3) The Commission estimates that there may be approximately 638,000-716,000 slant-sided, metal refuse bins with an internal volume one cubic yard or greater, which may be unstable. The population of potentially unstable bins owned by some 10,000-15,000 private solid waste collection firms in all parts of the United States and its territories is estimated to be 359,000-371,000. These figures are discussed in the Commission's Economic Impact Statement of April 22, 1977, which is available for review from the Commission's Office of the Secretary, Washington, D.C. 20207.",
            "(c) Need of the public for the product and effects on utility, cost, and availability. (1) The public need for refuse bins is substantial since these products are used for the containment of solid waste and thus contribute to public hygiene. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that 135,000,000 tons of solid waste were collected in 1976 from residential, commercial and industrial sources. Approximately 101,250,000 tons (75%) were collected by private firms and the remainder by public agencies.",
            "(2) The Commission finds that the ban will not affect the utility that consumers derive from the general use of refuse bins. The interest of the public is in continuity, availability and price of solid waste collection. The ban could result in a shift from bins which are subject to the ban to other types of storage containers. Such a shift would not affect solid waste collection and would entail a small price increase for individual consumers. To the extent that injuries and deaths associated with the use of unstable bins are reduced or eliminated as a result of the ban, the public utility derived from the use of the product will be increased.",
            "(3)(i) The Commission finds that, based on its analysis of industrial estimates, newly produced complying refuse bins will cost approximately 1-10% more than currently produced noncomplying bins and that existing inventories of unstable bins can be modified (depending upon size) for about $45-$75 each. This modification cost estimate includes the cost of material, shop labor, retrieval and return to service, and the substitution of one bin for another for on-site service.",
            "(ii) The Commission estimates that the ban will not result in any significant price increases for the delivery of solid waste collection service to the general public because of the competitive structure of the solid waste collection industry.",
            "(4) The Commission finds that the ban will have no effect on the availability of solid waste collection service to the general public. Solid waste collection haulers who use products subject to this ban can modify these refuse bins so that these products can continue to be used for solid waste collection.",
            "(d) Alternatives. (1) The Commission has considered other means of achieving the objective of this ban, but has found none that it believes would have fewer adverse effects on competition or that would cause less disruption or dislocation of manufacturing, servicing or other commercial practices consistent with public health and safety. The Commission estimates that this ban may, because of capital and testing costs and maintenance capacity limitations, have an adverse effect on individual firms within some markets.",
            "(2) The Commission estimates that the ban will not have an adverse effect on the competitive structure of the solid waste collection industry. The competitive nature of solid waste collection firms is fostered because of low starting costs, particularly if a firm is owner-operated. The rate of entry and exit into and out of the industry for small operators tends to be high relative to larger firms in the industry. The ban will most likely not increase the degree of market concentration among the larger firms nor affect the rate of entry into or exit out of the industry by relatively smaller firms.",
            "(3) Table 3 of the Economic Impact Statement indicates that about 85 percent of the private sector trash haulers are those with a fleet size of about 10 trucks and have annual revenues under $1 million. These might be classified as small business firms. All firms in the trash hauling business would have two possible problems associated with the ban: cost and time to retrofit, and access to capital for retrofitting. The problem of raising capital to retrofit should not be a burden to small firms unless they are denied credit for factors not associated with this ban. The revised effective date from 9 to 12 months will extend both the time to retrofit and the time to search for capital sources, if necessary. We conclude that the small firms in the trash hauling industry will not experience undue hardship relative to their larger competitors.",
            "(e) Conclusion. (1) The Commission finds that this rule is reasonably necessary to eliminate or reduce the unreasonable risks of injury associated with refuse bins, as they are defined in \u00a7 1301.4, and which fail to meet the criteria specified in \u00a7 1301.5",
            "(2) Based on all of the above findings, the Commission finds that the issuance of this rule is in the public interest.",
            "(3) The Commission is aware of the fact that refuse bins are used for many years before being discarded. Estimates of their useful life range from 10 to 15 years. Although other products which may be hazardous may also have a long life in the hands of individual consumers, a substantial number of unstable refuse bins remain in commerce because they are rented or leased and are constantly available for use by large numbers of consumers. The combination of the long life of refuse bins plus the fact that unstable refuse bins could remain in commerce and be available for use by many people, persuaded the Commission to make this finding that no feasible consumer product safety standard under the CPSA could adequately protect the public from the unreasonable risk of injury associated with those unstable refuse bins coming under the coverage of this ban."

            "(a) In this part 1302 the Consumer Product Safety Commission (Commission) declares extremely flammable contact adhesives and similar liquid or semiliquid consumer products to be banned hazardous products under sections 8 and 9 of the Consumer Product Safety Act (CPSA) (15 U.S.C. 2057 and 2058). This ban applies to those extremely flammable contact adhesives and similar liquid or semiliquid consumer products, as defined in \u00a7 1302.3(b), which are in commerce or are being distributed in commerce on or after the effective date of this regulation, and which are consumer products (as defined in section 3(a) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 2052) customarily produced or distributed for sale to, or for the personal use, consumption or enjoyment of consumers in or around a permanent or temporary household or residence, a school, in recreation or otherwise.",
            "(b) An extremely flammable contact adhesive as defined in \u00a7 1302.3(b) is a banned hazardous product if the manufacturer, distributor, or retailer customarily produces or distributes the product for sale to, or use by consumers, or if the manufacturer, distributor, or retailer fosters or facilitates the product's sale to, or use by, consumers. For example, contact adhesives available in retail stores, such as lumber yards or hardware stores, for sale to consumers would be included in the scope of the ban even though such outlets may sell such products primarily to industrial or professional users. The manufacturer who markets an extremely flammable contact adhesive which would be subject to the ban if sold to consumers has the responsibility for determining the distribution and use patterns of its product and for taking all reasonable steps to ensure that the product is not made available for sale to consumers. The test of whether a contact adhesive is banned shall be whether the product, under any customary or reasonably foreseeable condition of distribution, or sale, is made available for purchase by consumers.",
            "(c) Contact adhesives that are labeled as, marketed, and sold solely for industrial or professional use are not within the scope of this ban. However, merely labeling a contact adhesive for industrial or professional use only would not exclude such products from this ban. In addition, packaging a contact adhesive in a large size container would not in itself exclude the product from this ban.",
            "(d) The Commission has found that the contact adhesives covered by this ban are being, or will be distributed in commerce; and present an unreasonable risk of injury; and that no feasible consumer product safety standard under the CPSA would adequately protect the public from the unreasonable risk of injury associated with these products."

            "(a) The degree and nature of the risk of injury. The Commission finds that the risk of injury which this regulation is designed to eliminate or reduce is the risk of injury of burns from explosive vapor ignition and flashback fire associated with extremely flammable contact adhesives as defined in this rule.",
            "(1) Degree of the risk of injury presented by extremely flammable contact adhesives. (i) In October 1976, the Commission's staff prepared a report entitled Hazard Analysis on Contact Adhesive Fires. According to the Hazard Analysis, three factors that measure burn severity are percent of body burned, days hospitalized, and whether clothing ignition occurs. Injury data sources summarized in the Hazard Analysis reveal that contact adhesive fires often result in a high percent of body burned, result in many days hospitalized, and usually involve clothing ignition burns.",
            "(ii) The American Burn Association (ABA) participated in a special survey with the Commission to obtain an estimate of the incidence and severity of burns associated with the use of contact adhesive cements. In January 1976, the President of the ABA sent a letter to the 1,300 ABA members asking the members to record any thermal injuries or deaths that have occurred between January 1975 and March 1976 associated with contact adhesives. In November 1976, the Chairman of the ABA Committee on Burn Prevention submitted a statement to the Commission estimating that between 45 and 125 contact adhesive related injuries are treated annually in hospital emergency rooms. Although ABA members reported an annual rate of 20 severe burn injuries for the January 1975 to March 1976 period, the actual rate of severe burn injuries may be higher, since only approximately 400 hospitals, less than 10 percent of the country's short-term hospitals, are represented in ABA membership. The results of the ABA survey, as reported by the ABA Chairman, showed that the injuries treated by members resulted in an average hospitalization of 42 days, almost double the length of stay for all burn victims in special facilities for burns. According to the ABA Chairman, when a burn victim experiences such a lengthy stay, it is an indication of very severe injury and predicts a lengthy period of recuperation and potentially permanent physical and psychological consequences.",
            "(iii) The Hazard Analysis prepared by the Commission's staff also contains a summary of the results of the ABA survey. According to the Commission's staff, the ABA survey revealed 33 incidents with sufficient details for analysis. Nine of the victims died from their burns and 21 were hospitalized. The average body area burned was 40 percent. In addition, the victims' clothing ignited on all except three of the 33 victims.",
            "(iv) The Hazard Analysis also contains a summary of contact adhesive related fires in the National Fire Protection Association's (NFPA) Fire Incident Data Organization (FIDO), a computerized file of fire experience that includes data collected from 1971 to 1975. The NFPA files contained reports of 38 fires from 1971 to 1975, seven of which occurred in residences. These seven fires resulted in injuries to fifteen persons and deaths to three persons.",
            "(v) In addition to the above injury information, the Hazard Analysis also indicates that the Commission has received three death certificates specifying the involvement of an adhesive.",
            "(vi) According to the hazard analysis, after cases from the various data sources were verified as being mutually exclusive, at least 130 persons have been injured in contact adhesive fires since 1970. Fifteen of these persons subsequently died from the injuries they sustained in these accidents.",
            "(vii) Technical analysis of extremely flammable contact adhesives by the Commission's staff indicates that the degree of the hazard associated with these products is such that as little as one pint of extremely flammable contact adhesive may produce a substantial explosion hazard.",
            "(2) Nature of the risk of injury presented by flammable contact adhesives. (i) Technical analysis of these substances by the Commission's staff indicates that extremely flammable contact adhesives have a low flash point (20 \u00b0F or below), a rapid evaporation rate (as a result of a high percentage of solvents, 70-90 percent by weight), a low percentage of solids, 10-30 percent by weight, and a low wet-viscosity (300-6,000 centipoise when measured by an RVF Brookfield viscometer).",
            "(ii) Flash point, viscosity, low solid to high solvent ratio, evaporation rate, size of the application area, and rate of application are factors which determine the potential for creating an ignitable vapor situation. The rapid rate of evaporation of extremely volatile, low flash point solvents from extremely flammable contact adhesives is capable of creating a highly explosive atmosphere. The flammable nature of these contact adhesives is such that the vaporized solvents from these products can be ignited by a sparking electric motor or an overlooked pilot light in an area remote from the site of use. Analysis of actual injury reports by the Commission's staff reveals that extremely flammable contact adhesives have, in fact, been ignited by many ignition sources including oven and stove pilot lights, water heater and furnace pilot lights, electric space heaters (without any visible flame), sparks from a refrigerator motor and a wall receptacle, and friction. Analysis of available injury reports has shown that these ignition sources are frequently located in areas of the house remote from the room in which the contact adhesive is being used.",
            "(iii) The possibility of ignition from a source in another room or another part of the house may well be overlooked by the public, in spite of warnings on the label of the product. Ignition of the vapors may result in a sudden, flash back fire from the source of vapor ignition to the container of adhesive with little or no warning to the consumer and with the potential for serious or fatal injury to the user or bystanders. The injury information available to the Commission shows that the vast majority of accidents occur while the product is being used for its intended purpose. The potential for serious injury, therefore, appears to be present during normal use of the product.",
            "(iv) Although the Commission has in the past required the extremely flammable contact adhesives now subject to this ban to bear minimum cautionary labeling for the hazard caused by the extreme flammability of the mixture, the Commission finds that this cautionary labeling is inadequate to protect the public. An analysis prepared by the Commission staff of the available injury data indicates that in spite of the cautionary labeling, accidents have continued to occur, inflicting serious injuries in much the same manner as those accidents that occurred prior to the issuance of the 1970 labeling regulation. The cautionary labeling presently required could be revised to include more explicit and graphic warnings. However, as a result of the degree and nature of the risk of injury presented by the product, this labeling would also provide inadequate protection to the public. The degree and nature of the risk of injury is such that a bystander or visitor could present an ignition source resulting in an accident. Since the bystander or visitor would not normally have an opportunity to read the warning label on the product, additional labeling would not benefit these potential victims. The possibility of ignition from a source in another room or another part of the house may well be overlooked by the public, in spite of warnings on the label of the product.",
            "(b) Products subject to this ban. (1) The products banned by this rule are listed in \u00a7 1302.1.",
            "(2) The Commission finds that the types of products subject to this ban are those contact adhesives that are extremely flammable and are packaged in containers of more than one-half pint. The average annual consumption of all types of contact adhesives in the United States is estimated at approximately 25 million gallons. Of this, it is estimated that 4-5 million gallons are sold in containers of 1 gallon or less, the sizes consumers generally buy. Professional users are estimated to purchase about half of the contact adhesives in this size range with most purchases probably of gallon containers. Therefore, consumers probably purchase 2-2.5 million gallon of all contact adhesives, most of which is estimated to be in quart containers, and a smaller amount in containers of one pint or less.",
            "(3) In early 1976, contact adhesive sales were estimated as 80 percent extremely flammable, 10 percent chlorinated-solvent based, and 10 percent water-based. Since that time, a flammable petroleum solvent based contact adhesive has been developed and there has been a trend away from extremely flammable to flammable and nonflammable for consumer use. Although this trend is evident, reliable estimates of current market shares are not available. A rough estimate would be that perhaps 50 percent of contact adhesives in container sizes of more than one-half pint to 1 gallon are extremely flammable.",
            "(c) Need of the public for the products and effects of the rule on their utility, cost, and availability.",
            "(1) The need for contact adhesives. Contact adhesives are used primarily for bonding plastic laminates to counter and table tops, for applying tile board to walls, and for applying some types of flooring. Other uses include bonding metals, wood, leather, linoleum, tiles, rubber and plastics. Contact adhesives may also be used in furniture construction and repairs. There are contact adhesives available other than the extremely flammable type and other alternatives to contact adhesives that consumers can use.",
            "(2) Probable effects of the ban on the utility of contact adhesives. Of the three general types of contact adhesive other than extremely flammable contact adhesives, flammable and non-flammable (chlorinated) contact adhesives have about the same general performance characteristics as extremely flammable contact adhesives. Therefore, because these two products are available to the public, the Commission believes the ban will have little impact on the utility of contact adhesives. In terms of performance characteristics, there is little difference between flammable and extremely flammable contact adhesives. Although the extremely flammable product requires approximately 10 minutes of drying time before the item can be bonded, the flammable product requires about 20 minutes. This difference in time is not likely to be significant for most consumers who do ordinary home improvement or repair work. The performance characteristics of non-flammable chlorinated based contact adhesives are similar to those of the extremely flammable type for most applications. Non-flammable chlorinated based contact adhesives may be unacceptable for applications involving leather. Water based contact adhesives may not be as satisfactory, in terms of performance characteristics, as the other contact adhesives. The drying time for water-based contact adhesives varies with humidity. Although manufacturers of water-based neoprene contact adhesives claim that their products will dry in 30 minutes, for most of the country a drying time from one to four hours is probably more realistic. It is possible that the adhesive will never dry in some areas of the country with very high humidity. The time needed for the adhesive to adhere after joining (open time) will also vary with the humidity. Water-based acrylic contact adhesives are similar to neoprene type adhesives in terms of the effect of humidity on drying time. The neoprene and acrylic based adhesives are not completely satisfactory for binding some substances with non-porous surfaces, such as metals. In addition, the water in these adhesives might have an adverse effect on leather. Neoprene water-based adhesives may become unstable if frozen and thawed several times. This may occur during shipping or storage in some areas of the country during deaths associated with the extreme winter. To the extent that injuries and flammable contact adhesives are reduced or eliminated as a result of the ban, the utility of contact adhesives will be increased.",
            "(3) Probable effects of the ban upon the cost of contact adhesives. For gallon containers, the Commission estimates that the contact adhesives available as substitutes for the extremely flammable type may cost in the range of $1-$6 more than the extremely flammable type. Although a gallon of extremely flammable contact adhesive may cost $7.50-$10.50, a gallon of flammable contact adhesive may cost from $8-$11, a gallon of nonflammable chlorinated base contact adhesive may cost from $12-$15, a gallon of water-based neoprene contact adhesive may cost from $11-$16, and a gallon of water-based acrylic contact adhesive may cost from $10-$15.",
            "(4) Probable effect of the ban on the availability of contact adhesives to meet the need of the public. The Commission estimates that the ban will not have any effect on the availability or use of contact adhesives. Manufacturers are most likely to switch production to flammable petroleum-based and to 1,1,1,-trichloroethane (1,1,1,-TCE) based or water-based contact adhesives.",
            "(d) Alternatives. (1) The Commission has considered other means of achieving the objective of this rule, such as labeling, but has found none that would achieve the objective of this ban, consistent with the public health and safety.",
            "(2) The Commission believes that any adverse effects of the ban should be minimal and would be expected to be confined to some shift in distribution patterns to accommodate professional users, including methods of distinguishing between professional users and consumers.",
            "(3) The Commission finds that competition should not be significantly affected by this rule.",
            "(e) Conclusion. The Commission finds that this rule, including its effective date, is reasonably necessary to eliminate or reduce the unreasonable risk of injury of burns from explosive vapor ignition and flashback fire that is associated with the banned products described in \u00a7 1302.3(b). The Commission also finds that issuance of the rule is in the public interest. The Commission also finds that no feasible consumer product safety standard under the act would adequately protect the public from the unreasonable risk of injury associated with the product."

            "(2) Furniture articles for consumer use that bear \u201clead-containing paint\u201d.",
            "(b) This ban applies to the products in the categories described in paragraph (a) of this section that are manufactured after February 27, 1978, and which are \u201cconsumer products\u201d as that term is defined in section 3(a)(1) of the Consumer Product Safety Act. Accordingly, those of the products described above that are customarily produced or distributed for sale to or for use, consumption, or enjoyment of consumers in or around a household, in schools, in recreation, or otherwise are covered by the regulation. Paints and coatings for motor vehicles and boats are not included within the scope of the ban because they are outside the statutory definition of \u201cconsumer product\u201d. In addition to those products which are sold directly to consumers, the ban applies to products which are used or enjoyed by consumers after sale, such as paints used in residences, schools, hospitals, parks, playgrounds, and public buildings or other areas where consumers will have direct access to the painted surface.",
            "(c) The Commission has issued the ban because it has found that there is an unreasonable risk of lead poisoning in children associated with lead content of over 0.06 percent in paints and coatings to which children have access and that no feasible consumer product safety standard under the CPSA would adequately protect the public from this risk. The 0.06 percent is reduced to 0.009 percent effective August 14, 2009 as mandated by Congress in section 101(f) of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008, Public Law 110-314.",
            "(d) Any ban or rule promulgated under 16 CFR 1303.1 shall be considered a regulation of the Commission promulgated under or for the enforcement of section 2(q) of the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (15 U.S.C. 1261(q))."

            "(a) The degree and nature of the risk of injury. (1) The Commission finds that the risk of injury which this regulation is designed to eliminate or reduce is lead poisoning in children. The adverse effects of this poisoning in children can cause a range of disorders such as hyperactivity, slowed learning ability, withdrawal, blindness, and even death. The final Environmental Impact Statement on Lead in Paint which is on file with the President's Council on Environmental Quality (and available for inspection in the Office of the Secretary) contains in appendix A a detailed discussion of the health effects of lead in paint. These effects will only be summarized here.",
            "(2) Lead is a cumulative toxic heavy metal which, in humans, exerts its effects on the renal, hematopoietic, and nervous systems. Newer concepts indicate that there are three stages to childhood lead poisoning. The adverse health effects in the first stage are not clinically present but metabolic changes can be observed. During the second stage or symptomatic stage such symptoms as loss of appetite, vomiting, apathy, drowsiness, and inability to coordinate voluntary muscle movements occur. The after effects of this stage include seizure disorders as well as various behavioral and functional disorders which are often included under the heading of minimal brain dysfunction. Studies suggest that this syndrome may include hyperactivity, impulsive behavior, prolonged reaction time, perceptual disorders and slowed learning ability. The adverse health effects of the third stage may be permanent and can include blindness, mental retardation, behavior disorders, and death.",
            "(3) The Commission notes that children with pica are of special concern with regard to lead poisoning. Pica, the repetitive ingestion of nonfood substances, occurs in 50 percent of children between the ages of one and three, and studies indicate that at this age lead is absorbed more rapidly than lead is absorbed in adults. Pica for paint is believed to be episodic and can occur 2 to 3 times a week.",
            "(4) The Commission also notes that there are no reports of injuries caused by lead paint poisoning in the Commission's National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) data, which reflect hospital emergency room treatment. Lead paint poisonings result from a chronic hazard rather than from an acute hazard of the type generally treated in emergency rooms; and NEISS reporting, therefore, does not reflect this type of chronic hazard or injuries.",
            "(5) Former U.S. Surgeon-General Jesse L. Steinfeld, however, estimated in 1971 that 400,000 pre-school American children have elevated body lead burdens. The National Bureau of Standards in 1972 estimated that 600,000 young children have unduly high lead blood content.",
            "(b) Products subject to this ban. (1) The products banned by this rule are listed in \u00a7 1303.4.",
            "(2) The term paint comprises a variety of coating materials such as interior and exterior household paints, varnishes, lacquers, stains, enamels, primers, and similar coatings formulated for use on various surfaces. Based on 1976 data, the Commission estimates that over 400 million gallons of paint a year valued at approximately $2.5 billion could potentially be subject to this rule.",
            "(3) All products commonly known as toys and other articles intended for the use of children are subject to this rule. The categories of products within this classification are numerous and include items and equipment for play, amusement, education, physical fitness, and care of children. Retail sales in 1976 of products considered to be toys or other articles intended for use of children are estimated at around $4 billion.",
            "(4) For the purposes of this rule, furniture articles are certain movable articles used to support people or things or other functional or decorative furniture articles such as couches, beds, tables, chairs, chests, and the like. Appliances and similar equipment, household fixtures, and certain other household items such as window shades, blinds, wall hangings, and the like are not included within the definition of furniture. The regulation applies to furniture for use in households, schools, in recreation, or otherwise. In 1972, the value of shipments of items of furniture such as those named above was as follows: wood household furniture $2,716 million; metal household furniture $859 million; wood television and radio cabinets $293 million; and $190 million for other household furniture made of plastic, reed and rattan. (Not included in the above are some $2 billion worth of upholstered furniture and $300 million in convertible sofas, chair beds and studio couches.)",
            "(c) Need of the public for the products and effects of the rule on their utility, cost, and availability. (1) The public need for paints of various types and for furniture and other articles is substantial and well established. The Commission finds that the need of the public for paint containing more than 0.06 percent lead or for the affected products that are coated with materials containing more than 0.06 percent lead is limited. The Commission has determined that there are products containing more than the 0.06 percent level of lead which meet a public need and for which substitutes are either not available or are not sufficiently effective and to which access by children to the coatings or the surfaces to which they are applied is unlikely. Accordingly, these products have been specifically exempted from the scope of the regulation in \u00a7 1303.3.",
            "(2) The Commission finds that the effects of this rule on the cost, utility, and availability of paints and painted articles will be small. The Commission notes that over 95 percent of latex-based and nearly 70 percent of oil-based paints have lead levels at or below the level set by part 1303.",
            "(i) Costs. The Commission estimates that the added costs to the consumer for paints affected by this rule will not exceed 5 to 10 cents per gallon. Costs to consumers for furniture and for toys and other articles intended for the use of children are not expected to increase as the result of compliance with the regulation.",
            "(ii) Utility. The Commission finds that for water-based or latex paints and coatings subject to this rule, reducing the amount of allowable lead to 0.06 percent will not have adverse effects on their utility. For certain solvent-thinned coatings, however, lead driers will have to be replaced by non-lead driers such as zirconium to comply with the 0.06 percent level (Driers are not used in latex paints). An impact on the paint industry may result because current nonlead driers may not dry satisfactorily in low temperatures or high humidity conditions, and so the painting industry in some areas at certain times of the year may suffer a reduction of effective painting time.",
            "(iii) Availability. Substitutes at comparable prices are available for paints and for products banned by this rule. The Commission believes that the reduction of lead to a level of 0.06 percent will not affect the availabilty of water-based or latex paints. Sales of such coatings currently exceed sales of solvent-based coatings, and because of the drying problem mentioned above, the trend toward increased use of water-based paints may be accelerated somewhat by the effects of the ban.",
            "(d) Alternatives. (1) The Commission has considered other means of achieving the objective of this rule, but has found none that would cause less disruption or dislocation of manufacturing and other commercial practices, consistent with public health and safety.",
            "(2) The Commission estimates that this ban may, because of testing costs and the necessity for improved housekeeping practices in the manufacture of paint and similar surface-coating materials to prevent lead contaimination, have some relatively minor adverse effect on individual firms within some markets.",
            "(3) The Commission, however, finds that competition will not be adversely affected by this rule. Although costs of reformulation and testing may be relatively higher for small manufacturers than large manufacturers, these costs are not so onerous as to lead to greater concentration in the industry. The period of time before the effective date is sufficient to minimize problems of compliance with the rule.",
            "(4) The reduction of the permissible level of lead in paint will affect paint manufacturers, raw materials suppliers, professional and non-professional painters, and manufacturers of furniture and children's articles. For those producers of paint which are already subject to the regulations under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (FHSA), the impact of this CPSA ban will involve only a change to non-lead driers since lead pigments are precluded from practical use under the 0.5 percent lead restriction now in effect under the FHSA (16 CFR 1500.17(a)(6)). The manufacturers of some painted furniture who were not affected by the 0.5 percent limit under the FHSA may now be, if they use lead pigments or driers. Producers of children's articles who were subject to the 0.5 percent FHSA limit will have to ensure that the paint they use conforms to the 0.06 percent level.",
            "(e) Conclusion. The Commission finds that this rule, including its effective date, is reasonably necessary to eliminate or reduce the unreasonable risk of lead poisoning of young children that is associated with the banned products which are described in \u00a7 1303.4 and that promulgation of the rule is in the public interest."

            "(a) In this part 1304 the Consumer Product Safety Commission declares that consumer patching compounds containing intentionally-added respirable freeform asbestos in such a manner that the asbestos fibers can become airborne under reasonably foreseeable conditions of use, are banned hazardous products under sections 8 and 9 of the Consumer Product Safety Act (CPSA) (15 U.S.C. 2057 and 2058). This ban applies to patching compounds which are (1) used to cover, seal or mask cracks, joints, holes and similar openings in the trim, walls, ceiling, etc. of building interiors, which after drying are sanded to a smooth finish and (2) are produced and distributed for sale to or for the personal use, consumption or enjoyment of a consumer in or around a permanent or temporary household or residence, a school, in recreation or otherwise.",

This rule applies to the banned hazardous products defined in \u00a7 1304.3 and described further in \u00a7 1304.4.",
            "(c) Only consumer products are subject to this regulation. Patching compounds which are consumer products include those which a consumer can purchase. Merely labeling a patching compound for industrial use would not exclude such articles from the ban. If the sale or use of the product by consumers is facilitated, it is subject to the ban. Patching compounds which are labeled as, marketed, and sold solely for industrial use in non-consumer environments are not subject to the ban. In addition to those products which can be sold directly to consumers, the ban applies to patching compounds containing respirable free-form asbestos which are used in residences, schools, hospitals, public buildings or other areas where consumers have customary access."

          "paragraphs": [
            "(a) The degree and nature of the risk of injury. The Commission finds that the risk of injury which this regulation is designed to eliminate or reduce is from cancer, including lung cancer and mesothelioma. In assessing the degree and nature of the risk of injury to consumers, the Commission has reviewed experimental data and human experience information. The Commission noted that in the scientific literature, there is general agreement that there is no known threshold level below which exposure to respirable free-form asbestos would be considered safe. Further, on the basis of such scientific opinion, it appears to the Commission that children are particularly vulnerable to carcinogens because of their longer potential lifetime and their rapid rate of growth. In areas of the country where asbestos may not be prevalent in the environment, the major risk of exposure for children and others may occur in the household. In areas of the country where more asbestos fibers are present in the environment, the public is exposed to additional risks from the presence of asbestos fibers in households and other consumer environments. The Commission concluded on the basis of these factors that consumer patching compounds containing respirable free-form asbestos present an unreasonable risk of injury to the public. In addition, a risk assessment was made. For purposes of this assessment, the Commission considered the use of patching compounds by the consumer, for six hours a day four times a year, to be a high yet reasonably foreseeable exposure. The increased risk of death from respiratory cancer induced by this exposure is estimated at between 10 and 2,000 per million. For five years of exposure at these levels, the risk increases geometrically and is estimated at between 1,000 and 12,000 per million. The lower estimate of 10 per million is closer to the actual risk for a one-year exposure. Nevertheless, in view of the seriousness of the injury and the cumulative effects of asbestos exposure, even this minimum figure represents an unacceptable risk. The Commission believes that reducing exposure to respirable free-form asbestos in the home represents a substantial decrease in risk to consumers, since, for many people, the major exposure to inhalable asbestos is in the home.",
            "(b) Products subject to the ban. Consumer patching compounds as defined in \u00a7 1034.3 (d), (e), (f) includes such products as drywall spackling compounds and tape joint compounds (commonly known as \u201cjoint cement\u201d or \u201ctape joint mud\u201d). The Commission estimates annual shipments of patching compounds subject to the ban at approximately 30-50 million \u201cunits,\u201d or individual packages, of various sizes from 0.5 to 25 pounds (dry) or 0.5 to 5 gallons (wet). The Commission believes that about half the patching compounds sold in 1977, and intended for sale to or use or enjoyment by consumers, were formulated with asbestos. Many others containing significant levels of asbestos contamination will also be affected by the ban.",
            "(c) Need of the public for the products and effects of the rule on their utility, cost and availability. Patching compounds, though used primarily by commercial construction workers, are also used by consumers, and are used for the patching and sealing of cracks and joints in and around the household and in other consumer environments either by consumers or professional applicators. The compounds are used to cover areas on gypsum drywall which might otherwise be aesthetically undesirable or which might lead to structural damage, energy loss or lower property value. The asbestos in these compounds acts as a structural reinforcing agent which helps to reduce cracking and shrinkage of the compound over time, and which renders the compound more pliable or \u201cworkable\u201d upon application.",
            "(1) Utility. The elimination of asbestos from these products may result in the increased use or new development of substitutes which have similar properties to those of asbestos, or which impart similar qualities to the product. In current reformulations, asbestos is replaced by a combination of substances, of which the most common is attapulgite, a fibrous clay. Some non-asbestos formulations are reportedly not as effective as those containing asbestos in controlling shrinkage and cracking over time. The workability of some compounds may be diminished as well. This may adversely affect the utility derived from the product by consumers, and by professional contractors until such time as improved formulations are developed and available to end-users.",
            "(2) Cost. Asbestos-free patching compound formulations may require more time to use. This would tend to increase the direct labor costs of residential and other construction and renovation. The expected increase is between 10 and 25 percent. The Commission estimates that the annual labor cost of drywall finishing in these consumer environments is on the order of $1 billion. The use of nonasbestos patching compound formulations in all applications may increase this cost by $50-$125 million, assuming that roughly half the current labor costs (i.e., that portion now associated with the use of asbestos formulations) are affected by the 10-25 percent increase. The burden of this cost is expected to fall directly on owners of existing homes who may engage in some renovation, and on purchasers of newly-renovated or newly-constructed homes. These increased costs are expected to diminish over time as formulations improve and as applicators become more accustomed to using nonasbestos formulations. The use of asbestos substitutes may also lead to cost increases in the manufacture of patching compounds. The Commission estimates this cost, which may vary widely from firm to firm, at an average of 5-15 percent. This is made up primarily of increased costs of raw materials and of formulation research and development. It is expected that the price of many patching compounds may rise as a result. Producers, distributors, and retailers of patching compounds may also have to incur costs associated with the disposal of products in inventory. The Commission estimates that the wholesale value of manufacturers' and distributors' inventories at the time the ban becomes effective will be approximately $15 million. These costs may be reflected in the prices charged for asbestos-free patching compound formulations, and in the prices of other drywall and paint products. It appears that, because of competitive pressure from asbestos-containing compounds, producers of asbestos-free formulations have not yet passed on to purchasers their increased costs. If the increased production costs of asbestos-free formulations can be passed on completely as a result of the ban, the total annual price effect for the year following the issuance of the ban may be $10-$60 million. The magnitude of this effect may be reduced significantly in successive years following the issuance of the ban as producers' development costs are amortized, as raw materials become more widely available, and as price competition is strengthened because of market pressure and economies of sale associated with production.",
            "(3) Availability. The supply of asbestos substitutes, particularly attapulgite clay and relatively uncontaminated talc, for use in the manufacture of patching compounds may be insufficient to meet the short-run demand which is expected to be stimulated by the promulgation of the ban. Further, many small producers probably lack the technical capability to reformulate their products, and may be forced to cease production, at least until formulations of satisfactory cost and performance are developed. This may affect some professional contractors. In the short run, consumers may be indirectly affected by delays in drywall finishing and building completion.",
            "(d) Any means of achieving the objective of the ban while minimizing adverse effects on competition or disruption or dislocation of manufacturing and other commercial practices consistent with the public health and safety. The adverse effects of the ban on patching compounds containing asbestos is reduced by limiting the ban to intentionally added asbestos. Other alternatives such as limiting the scope of the ban only to products purchased and used by consumers or to issuing a ban with a later effective date, were considered by the Commission. However, none was found that would cause less disruption or dislocation of manufacturing and other commercial practices, consistent with public health and safety."

            "(a) The degree and nature of the risk of injury. The Commission finds that the risk of injury which this regulation is designed to eliminate or reduce is from cancer, including lung cancer and mesothelioma. Measurements are not available of the amounts of asbestos in the air from asbestos-containing emberizing materials in homes. However, it appears that the amount of airborne asbestos in such homes would increase when air currents in the home are created by downdrafts from a fireplace chimney or other activities that stir air in any room. Since emberizing materials may contain up to 50 percent asbestos, which if not permanently bound into artificial fireplace logs would be in respirable form, the risk associated with emberizing materials is considerable, especially since it continues to exist 24 hours a day.",
            "(b) Products subject to the ban. Artificial emberizing materials are decorative simulated ashes or embers, used in certain gas-buring fireplace systems, which glow to give the appearance of real burning embers. The material is sprinkled on or glued to gas logs, or sprinkled on fireplace floors.",
            "(c) Need of the public for the products and effects of the rule on their utility, cost, and availability. Artificial fireplace emberizing material serves a strictly decorative purpose and does not materially affect the actual performance of the fireplace gas system in terms of its ability to provide heat. A certain degree of aesthetic desirability exists, however, since the product \u201csystem\u201d itself (the gas log, ashes, and embers) is intended to simulate burning wooden logs. Gas logs may be sold with artificial emberizing material attached at the factory (the log commonly referred to as being \u201cfrosted\u201d), or with the \u201cembers\u201d in a separate kit, often mixed with simulated \u201cashes.\u201d Virtually all gas logs are either frosted or packaged with an emberizing kit; however, the majority of gas logs produced in 1977 were packaged with non-asbestos-containing emberizing kits. The Commission estimates annual sales of artificial gas logs at approximately 100,000 units. Some 25,000-30,000 of these would be subject to the ban. Approximately 100,000 gas logs frosted or treated by consumers with asbestos are estimated to be in existence. The Commission believes that the majority of gas logs are sold with emberizing kits; this gives the consumer a choice as to whether or not to use the artificial embers and ashes.",
            "(1) Utility. Manufacturers of artificial gas log emberizing material are currently using four substitutes for asbestos in their products: vermiculite, rock wool, mica, and a synthetic fiber. None of the four is claimed to be as aesthetically effective as asbestos. Thus, the utility derived by consumers from some gas-burning fireplace systems may be adversely affected.",
            "(2) Cost. No effect on the overall price level of gas logs is anticipated as a result of the ban. The average price of emberizing kits may rise somewhat; the Commission estimates the total price effect of the ban on consumers at under $25,000.",
            "(3) Availability. The Commission believes that all producers of artificial emberizing material will have eliminated asbestos from their products by the time the ban becomes effective. No significant impact on the availability of asbestos substitutes to producers nor on the availability of gas logs or emberizing kits to retail dealers and consumers is expected as a result of the ban.",
            "(d) Any means of achieving the objective of the ban while minimizing adverse effects on competition or disruption or dislocation of manufacturing and other commercial practices consistent with the public health and safety. The Commission believes that there will be minimal disruption to the market for artificial emberizing materials as a consequence of the ban and that no further reduction in adverse effects is feasible."

            "(a) The Commission has found that lawn darts are being distributed in commerce and present an unreasonable risk of injury.",
            "(b) The degree and nature of the risk of injury. (1) The risk that the Commission intends to address in this proceeding is that of puncture of the skulls of children caused by lawn darts being used by children. The potential for these devices to cause these types of injuries is not necessarily obvious to parents or other adults who might buy these items or allow their children to play with them, much less to the children themselves. This is because the tips do not appear sharp enough to present an obvious danger of puncture. The combined factors of weight, the narrow elongated shaft, the speed that the dart is traveling at the time of impact, and the thickness of the child's skull at the point of impact present the risk. The Commission has concluded that all lawn darts have the potential for skull puncture during reasonably foreseeable use or misuse.",
            "(2) Because all lawn darts are being banned, the elimination of lawn darts that can cause skull puncture injuries will also eliminate the punctures of other parts of the body, as well as the lacerations, fractures, and other injuries that have been associated with lawn darts in the past. The Commission's staff estimates that about 670 injuries from lawn darts are treated in U.S. hospital emergency rooms per year. About 40 percent of these are puncture wounds. Approximately 57 percent of the injuries involved the head, face, eye, or ear. Approximately 4 percent of the injured victims were hospitalized (on the average, approximately 25 per year), including all of the injuries reported as fractures. Over 75 percent of the victims were under age 15; about 50 percent of the victims were under age 10. In addition, Commission records dating back to 1970 show that at least three children have been killed by injuries associated with lawn darts. These children were 4, 7, and 13 years old. In the 25 lawn dart injury reports for which information about the user of the lawn darts was available, the reports indicated that children were playing with the lawn darts, despite the ban and exemption which were developed to keep the product out of the hands of children.",
            "(c) Products subject to this ban. (1) Lawn darts are devices with elongated tips that are intended to be used outdoors and that are designed so that when they are thrown into the air they will contact the ground tip first. Often, lawn darts are used in a game where the darts are thrown at a target or other feature on the ground. The types of lawn darts that have generally been available in the past and that have demonstrated their ability to cause skull puncture injuries typically have a metal or weighted plastic body, on the front of which is an elongated metal shaft about \n1/4 inch in diameter. These darts have a shaft on the rear of the body containing plastic fins. These darts are about a foot in length and weigh about one quarter to one half pound. These darts are intended to stick in the ground when thrown. Prior to this rule, annual sales of these lawn darts were estimated at 1-1.5 million units.",
            "(2) The definition for lawn darts in this rule is not intended to include arrows or horseshoes, nor is it intended to apply to indoor dart games that use a vertically-placed target, such as \u201cEnglish darts\u201d or \u201cAmerican darts.\u201d",
            "(d) The need of the public for lawn darts, and the effects of the rule on their utility, cost, and availability. The need of the public for lawn darts is for recreational enjoyment. Substitute recreational enjoyment can be obtained from other products. Lawn darts will not be available through commercial channels after the effective date of the ban.",
            "(e) Alternatives. (1) The Commission considered various labeling requirements and limitations on the marketing of lawn darts that would be intended to discourage the marketing of the product to children and the use of the product by children. The Commission concluded, however, that these types of requirements would not preclude substantial use of the product by children and would not reduce adequately the risk of injury addressed by this rule.",
            "(2) The Commission also considered the possibility of performance requirements for lawn darts to determine which lawn darts present an unreasonable risk of injury of skull penetration to children, but such requirements were determined not to be feasible.",
            "(f) Conclusion. The Commission finds:",
            "(1) That this rule, including its effective date, is reasonably necessary to eliminate or adequately reduce the unreasonable risk of skull puncture wounds to children associated with lawn darts and will also eliminate or reduce the other injuries, including puncture wounds, that have been associated with this product.",
            "(2) That issuance of the rule is in the public interest.",
            "(3) That no feasible consumer product safety standard would adequately protect the public from the unreasonable risk associated with lawn darts.",
            "(4) That the benefits expected from this rule bear a reasonable relationship to its costs.",
            "(5) That the rule imposes the least burdensome requirement which prevents or adequately reduces the risk of injury for which the rule is being promulgated."

The notification shall consist of a label on the product stating that it contains a chlorofluorocarbon that may harm the public health and environment by reducing the ozone in the upper atmosphere.

            "Chlorofluorocarbons are used as propellants in self-pressurized containers of a variety of products subject to the Commission's jurisdiction. Scientific research has indicated that chlorofluorocarbons may pose a risk of depletion of ozone in the stratosphere. The stratospheric ozone shield is of great importance in protecting life on earth from shortwave ultra-violet rays of the sun. Ozone depletion allows more of these rays to reach the earth, and the consequences include a possibility of a significant increase in human skin cancer and other effects of unknown magnitude on man, animals, and plants. Chlorofluorocarbon release may also cause climatic change, both by reducing stratospheric ozone and by increasing infrared absorption in the atmosphere. The Commission believes that the requirements of this part 1401 will enable consumers to make a conscious choice of whether to use products that contain chlorofluorocarbon propellants. The Commission also believes that these requirements are necessary in order to carry out the purposes of the Consumer Product Safety Act of (a) helping to protect the public against unreasonable risks of injury associated with consumer products and (b) assisting consumers in evaluating the comparative safety of consumer products."

            "(a) Fire data analyzed by the Consumer Product Safety Commission disclose a number of incidents involving coal and wood burning appliances. Many of these cases involve improper installation of the appliances, especially where they are installed with insufficient clearances to adjacent combustibles such as walls, ceilings, floors, draperies, carpets, or furnishings. Another common installation problem involves the use of improper types of chimneys or chimney connectors and insufficient clearances between these devices and combustibles. Other incidents involve improper operation of the appliance, such as by overfiring it or using flammable liquids to start the fire. Still other incidents occur when appliances are improperly maintained and develop mechanical defects or excessive deposits of flammable creosote.",
            "(b) After considering the available data on the causes of fires in these appliances, the Commission concludes that there is an unreasonable risk of injury associated with appliances that are sold without notifying consumers of the information they need to prevent many of these occurrences. Accordingly, the Commission has determined that disclosure of the information required by \u00a7 1406.4 is necessary to help the Commission in carrying out the purposes of the Consumer Product Safety Act of (1) helping to protect the public against unreasonable risks of injury associated with consumer products and (2) assisting consumers in evaluating the comparative safety of consumer products.",
            "(c) The Commission has also determined that in carrying out these purposes of the act, it is necessary for manufacturers to provide to the Commission a copy of the information provided to consumers and a statement of the reasons why some of the information was selected, in accordance with \u00a7 1406.5."

            "(a) Coal and wood burning appliances means fireplace stoves, room heater/fireplace stove combinations, cookstoves and ranges, and radiant and circulating heaters. It does not include central heating units, masonry fireplaces and chimneys, fireplace inserts, or factory built fireplaces (zero clearance fireplaces).",
            "(b) Central heating units include boilers, furnaces, and furnace add-ons. These appliances are designed to be connected to hot water distribution or ductwork systems for heating several rooms. The furnace add-on converts an existing gas, oil, or electric heating system to one capable of using solid fuel as well as its original fuel.",
            "(c) A chimney is a vertical or nearly vertical enclosure containing one or more passageways called flue passages for conveying combustion wastes to the outside atmosphere.",
            "(d) A chimney connector is the stovepipe which connects the appliance flue with the chimney flue.",
            "(e) Cookstoves and ranges are chimney connected solid fuel burning appliances that are used primarily for cooking. In addition to the firechamber, there may be one or more ovens or warmer compartments and several removable cooking space pothole lids. The intensity of the fire is controlled by damper and draft regulators.",
            "(f) A factory built fireplace is a firechamber and chimney assembly consisting entirely of factory made parts. It is designed for component assembly without requiring field construction. These \u201czero clearance\u201d units are fabricated for safe installation against combustible surfaces and for burning fireplace fuel.",
            "(g) Fireplace inserts are heating units that fit into a fireplace and connect to the fireplace flue. These units function like radiant and circulating heaters.",
            "(h) A fireplace stove is a freestanding, chimney-connected firechamber which is constantly open to view. It is designed to burn regular fireplace fuel and function as a decorative fireplace.",
            "(i) A masonry chimney is a chimney field-constucted of solid masonry units, brick, stones, or reinforced concrete.",
            "(j) A masonry fireplace is an open firechamber built into a structure along with a chimney and hearth. It is constructed of solid masonry units such as bricks, stones, or reinforced concrete.",
            "(k) Radiant and circulating heaters have firechambers which may be airtight \n1\n or non-airtight and are available in a number of sizes, shapes, and designs. The firechamber is closed in use, but there may be a window of specially formulated glass for viewing the fire. Drafts and dampers are used to control the burning process. There may be a secondary combustion chamber, baffles, a thermostat, a blower, or other components which function to improve combustion efficiency or to control heat output. The primary function of these appliances is as space heaters. However, some have lift-off cooking pothole lids, and the top surface of most can be used for cooking. The fuel may be wood, coal, or both. Radiant heaters transmit heat primarily by direct radiation. Circulating heaters have an outer jacket surrounding the fire chamber. Air enters from the bottom, is warmed by passing over the fire chamber, and exits at the top. Movement is by natural convection or forced air circulation.",
            "(l) A \u201croom heater/fireplace stove combination\u201d is a freestanding, chimney-connected fire chamber with doors. It is designed to be used to burn fireplace fuels with the firechamber either open or closed to view. This appliance functions as a decorative fireplace when the doors are open and as a non-airtight heater when the doors are closed."

            "(C) Rabbits (each weighing between 2.3 and 3.0 kilograms) when a dosage of more than 200 milligrams but not more than 2 grams per kilogram of body weight is administered by continuous contact with the bare skin for 24 hours by the method described in \u00a7 1500.40.",
            "(D) The number of animals tested shall be sufficient to give a statistically significant result and shall be in conformity with good pharmacological practices. Toxic also applies to any substance that can be labeled as such, based on the outcome of any of the approved test methods described in the CPSC's animal testing policy set forth in \u00a7 1500.232, including data from in vitro or in silico test methods that the Commission has approved; or a validated weight-of-evidence analysis comprising all of the following that are available: Existing human and animal data, structure activity relationships, physicochemical properties, and chemical reactivity data.",
            "(ii) Chronic toxicity. A substance is toxic because it presents a chronic hazard if it falls into one of the following categories. (For additional information see the chronic toxicity guidelines at 16 CFR 1500.135.)",
            "(A) For Carcinogens. A substance is toxic if it is or contains a known or probable human carcinogen.",
            "(B) For Neurotoxicological Toxicants. A substance is toxic if it is or contains a known or probable human neurotoxin.",
            "(C) For Developmental or Reproductive Toxicants. A substance is toxic if it is or contains a known or probable human developmental or reproductive toxicant.",
            "(3) The definition of corrosive in section 2(i) of the act (restated in paragraph (b)(7) of this section) is interpreted to also mean the following: Corrosive means a substance that causes visible destruction or irreversible alterations in the tissue at the site of contact. A test for a corrosive substance is whether, by human experience, such tissue destruction occurs at the site of application. A substance would be considered corrosive to the skin if a weight-of-evidence analysis suggests that it is corrosive, or validated in vitro test method suggests that it is corrosive, or if, when tested by the in vivo technique described in \u00a7 1500.41, the structure of the tissue at the site of contact is destroyed or changed irreversibly in 24 hours or less. Other appropriate tests should be applied when contact of the substance with other than skin tissue is being considered. A substance could also be labeled corrosive based on the outcome of any of the approved test methods described in the CPSC's animal testing policy set forth in 16 CFR 1500.232, including data from in vitro or in silico test methods that the Commission has approved; or a validated weight-of-evidence analysis comprising all of the following that are available: Existing human and animal data, structure activity relationships, physicochemical properties, and chemical reactivity data.",
            "(4) The definition of irritant in section 2(j) of the act (restated in paragraph (b)(8) of this section) is supplemented by the following: Irritant includes primary irritant to the skin, as well as substances irritant to the eye or to mucous membranes. Primary irritant means a substance that is not corrosive and that human experience data indicate is a primary irritant; and/or means a substance that results in an empirical score of five or more when tested by the method described in 1500.41; and/or a substance that can be considered a primary irritant based on the outcome of any of the approved test methods described in the CPSC's animal testing policy set forth in 16 CFR 1500.232, including data from in vitro or in silico test methods that the Commission has approved; or a validated weight-of-evidence analysis comprising all of the following that are available: existing human and animal data, structure activity relationships, physicochemical properties, and chemical reactivity data. Eye irritant means a substance that human experience data indicate is an irritant to the eye; and/or means a substance for which a positive test is obtained when tested by the method described in 1500.42; and/or means a substance that can be considered an eye irritant based on the outcome of any of the approved test methods described in the CPSC's animal testing policy set forth in 16 CFR 1500.232, including data from in vitro or in silico test methods that the Commission has approved; or a validated weight-of-evidence analysis comprising all of the following that are available: existing human and animal data, structure activity relationships, physicochemical properties, and chemical reactivity data.",
            "(5) The definition of strong sensitizer in section 2(k) of the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (restated in paragraph (b)(9) of this section) is supplemented by the following definitions:",
            "(i) Sensitizer. A sensitizer is a substance that is capable of inducing a state of immunologically mediated hypersensitivity (including allergic photosensitivity) following a variable period of exposure to that substance. Hypersensitivity to a substance will become evident by an allergic reaction elicited upon reexposure to the same substance.",
            "(ii) Significant potential for causing hypersensitivity. (A) Before designating any substance a \u201cstrong sensitizer,\u201d the Commission shall find that the substance has significant potential for causing hypersensitivity. Significant potential for causing hypersensitivity is a relative determination that must be made separately for each substance. The determination may be based on documented medical evidence of hypersensitivity reactions upon subsequent exposure to the same substance obtained from epidemiological surveys or case histories; controlled in vivo or in vitro experimental studies; susceptibility profiles (e.g., genetics, age, gender, atopic status) in non-sensitized or allergic subjects; and chemical or functional properties of the substance.",
            "(B) In determining whether a substance is a \u201cstrong\u201d sensitizer, the Commission shall consider the available data for a number of factors, following a weight-of-evidence approach. The following factors (if available), ranked in descending order of importance, should be considered: well-conducted clinical and diagnostic studies, epidemiological studies, with a preference for general population studies over occupational studies, well-conducted animal studies, well-conducted in vitro test studies, cross-reactivity data, and case histories.",
            "(C) Additional consideration may be given to Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships (QSARs), in silico data, specific human sensitization threshold values, other data on potency and sensitizer bioavailability, if data are available and the methods validated. Bioavailability is the dose of the allergen available to interact with a tissue. Bioavailability is a reflection of how well the skin or another organ can absorb the allergen and the actual penetrating ability of the allergen, including factors such as size and composition of the chemical.",
            "(D) Criteria for a \u201cwell-conducted\u201d study would include: validated outcomes, relevant dosing, route of administration, and use of appropriate controls. Studies should be carried out according to national and/or international test guidelines and according to good laboratory practice (GLP), compliance with good clinical practice (GCP), and good epidemiological practice (GEP).",
            "(E) Before the Commission designates any substance as a \u201cstrong\u201d sensitizer, frequency of occurrence and range of severity of reactions in exposed subpopulations having average or high susceptibility will be considered. The minimal severity of a reaction for the purpose of designating a material as a \u201cstrong sensitizer\u201d is a clinically important reaction. A clinically important reaction would be considered one with a significant impact on quality of life. Consideration should be given to the location of the hypersensitivity response, such as the face, hands, and feet as well as persistence of clinical manifestations. For example, strong sensitizers may produce substantial illness, including any or all of the following: substantial physiological effects, such as discomfort and distress, substantial hardship, functional or structural impairment, persistent morbidity, or in rare cases, mortality.",
            "(iii) Normal living tissue. The allergic hypersensitivity reaction occurs in normal living tissues, including the skin, mucous membranes (e.g., ocular, oral), and other organ systems, such as the respiratory tract and gastrointestinal tract, either singularly or in combination, following sensitization by contact, ingestion, or inhalation.",
            "(6) The Consumer Product Safety Commission, by the regulations published in this section, defines the terms extremely flammable, flammable, and combustible, appearing in section 2(1) of the Federal Hazardous Substances Act, as follows:",
            "(i) The term extremely flammable shall apply to any substance which has a flashpoint at or below 20 \u00b0F (\u22126.7 \u00b0C) as determined by the test method described at \u00a7 1500.43a, except that, any mixture having one component or more with a flashpoint higher than 20 \u00b0F (\u22126.7 \u00b0C) which comprises at least 99 percent of the total volume of the mixture is not considered to be an extremely flammable substance.",
            "(ii) The term flammable shall apply to any substance having a flashpoint above 20 \u00b0F (\u22126.7 \u00b0C) and below 100 \u00b0F (37.8 \u00b0C), as determined by the method described at \u00a7 1500.43a, except that:",

            "(B) Any mixture containing 24 percent or less of water miscible alcohols, by volume, in aqueous solution is not considered to be flammable if the mixture does not present a significant flammability hazard when used by consumers.",
            "(iii) The term combustible shall apply to any substance having a flashpoint at or above 100 \u00b0F (37.8 \u00b0C) to and including 150 \u00b0F (65.6 \u00b0C) as determined by the test method described at \u00a7 1500.43a, except that:",
            "(A) Any mixture having one component or more with a flashpoint higher than 150 \u00b0F (65.6 \u00b0C) which comprises at least 99 percent of the total volume of the mixture is not considered to be a combustible hazardous substance; and",
            "(B) Any mixture containing 24 percent or less of water miscible alcohols, by volume, in aqueous solution is not considered to be combustible if the mixture does not present a significant flammability hazard when used by consumers.",
            "(iv) To determine flashpoint temperatures for purposes of enforcing and administering requirements of the Federal Hazardous Substances Act applicable to \u201cextremely flammable,\u201d \u201cflammable,\u201d and \u201ccombustible\u201d hazardous substances, the Commission will follow the procedures set forth in \u00a7 1500.43a. However, the Commission will allow manufacturers and labelers of substances and products subject to those requirements to rely on properly conducted tests using the Tagliabue open-cup method which was in effect prior to the issuance of \u00a7 1500.43a (as published at 38 FR 27012, September 27, 1973, and set forth below), and the defintions of the terms \u201cextremely flammable,\u201d \u201cflammable,\u201d and \u201ccombustible\u201d in this section before its amendment (as published at 38 FR 27012, September 27, 1983, and amended 38 FR 30105, November 1, 1973, set forth in the note following this section) if all of the following conditions are met:",
            "(A) The substance or product was subject to and complied with the requirements of the Federal Hazardous Substances Act for \u201cextremely flammable,\u201d \u201cflammable,\u201d or \u201ccombustible\u201d hazardous substances before the effective date of \u00a7 1500.43a; and",
            "(B) No change has been made to the formulation or labeling of such substance or product after the effective date of \u00a7 1500.43a, prescribing a closed-cup test apparatus and procedure.",
            "(v) Extremely flammable solid means a solid substance that ignites and burns at an ambient temperature of 80 \u00b0F or less when subjected to friction, percussion, or electrical spark.",
            "(vi) Flammable solid means a solid substance that, when tested by the method described in \u00a7 1500.44, ignites and burns with a self-sustained flame at a rate greater than one-tenth of an inch per second along its major axis.",

            "(i) Hazardous substances intended, or packaged in a form suitable, for use in the household means any hazardous substance, whether or not packaged, that under any customary or reasonably foreseeable condition of purchase, storage, or use may be brought into or around a house, apartment, or other place where people dwell, or in or around any related building or shed including, but not limited to, a garage, carport, barn, or storage shed. The term includes articles, such as polishes or cleaners, designed primarily for professional use but which are available in retail stores, such as hobby shops, for nonprofessional use. Also included are items, such as antifreeze and radiator cleaners, that although principally for car use may be stored in or around dwelling places. The term does not include industrial supplies that might be taken into a home by a serviceman. An article labeled as, and marketed solely for, industrial use does not become subject to this act because of the possibility that an industrial worker may take a supply for his own use. Size of unit or container is not the only index of whether the article is suitable for use in or around the household; the test shall be whether under any reasonably foreseeable condition of purchase, storage, or use the article may be found in or around a dwelling.",
            "(ii) Conspicuously in section 2(p)(1) of the act and prominently and conspicuous in section 2(p)(2) of the act mean that, under customary conditions of purchase, storage, and use, the required information shall be visible, noticeable, and in clear and legible English. Some factors affecting a warning's prominence and conspicuousness are: Location, size of type, and contrast of printing against background. Also bearing on the effectiveness of a warning might be the effect of the package contents if spilled on the label."

            "(ii) The following shall apply with respect to the standard for art materials set forth in \u00a7 1500.14(b)(8)(i).",
            "(A) The term art material or art material product shall mean any substance marketed or represented by the producer or repackager as suitable for use in any phase of the creation of any work of visual or graphic art of any medium. The term does not include economic poisons subject to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act or drugs, devices, or cosmetics subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act.",
            "(B) The standard referred to in paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section applies to art materials intended for users of any age.",
            "(C) Each producer or repackager of art materials shall describe in writing the criteria used to determine whether an art material has the potential for producing chronic adverse health effects. Each producer or repackager shall submit, to the Commission's Division of Regulatory Management, Consumer Product Safety Commission, Washington, DC 20207, the written description of the criteria described above and a list of art materials that require hazard warning labels under this section. Upon request of the Commission, a producer or repackager shall submit to the Commission product formulations.",
            "(D) All art materials that require chronic hazard labeling pursuant to this section must include on the label the name and United States address of the producer or repackager of the art materials, an appropriate United States telephone number that can be contacted for more information on the hazards requiring warning labels under this section, and a statement that such art materials are inappropriate for use by children.",
            "(E) If an art material producer or repackager becomes newly aware of any significant information regarding the hazards of an art material or ways to protect against the hazard, this new information must be incorporated into the labels of such art materials that are manufactured after 12 months from the date of discovery. If a producer or repackager reformulates an art material, the new formulation must be evaluated and labeled in accordance with the standard set forth \u00a7 1500.14(b)(8)(i).",
            "(F) In determining whether an art material has the potential for producing chronic adverse health effects, including carcinogenicity and potential carcinogenicity, the toxicologist to whom the substance is referred under the standard described above shall take into account opinions of various regulatory agencies and scientific bodies, including the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).",
            "(iii) Pursuant to the LHAMA, the Commission has issued guidelines which, where possible, specify criteria for determining when any customary or reasonably foreseeable use of an art material can result in a chronic hazard. These guidelines include criteria for determining when art materials may produce chronic adverse effects in children and adults, criteria for determining which substances contained in art materials have the potential for producing chronic adverse effects and what those effects are, criteria for determining the bioavailability of chronically hazardous substances contained in art materials when the products are used in a customary or reasonably foreseeable manner, and criteria for determining acceptable daily intake levels for chronically hazardous substances contained in art materials. Because these guidelines apply to hazardous substances in general as well as to hazardous substances in art materials, the guidelines are set forth in \u00a7 1500.135 and a definition of \u201cchronic toxicity\u201d is provided in \u00a7 1500.3(c)(2)(ii) as part of supplementation of the term \u201ctoxic\u201d in section 2(q) of the FHSA.",
            "(iv) Policies and interpretations. (A) For purposes of enforcement policy, the Commission will not consider as sufficient grounds for bringing an enforcement action under the Labeling of Hazardous Art Materials Act (\u201cLHAMA\u201d) the failure of the following types of products to meet the requirements of \u00a7 1500.14(b)(8) (i) through (iii).",
            "(1) Products whose intended general use is not to create art (e.g., common wood pencils, and single colored pens, markers, and chalk), unless the particular product is specifically packaged, promoted, or marketed in a manner that would lead a reasonable person to conclude that it is intended for use as an art material. Factors the Commission would consider in making this determination are how an item is packaged (e.g., packages of multiple colored pencils, chalks, or markers unless promoted for non-art materials uses are likely to be art materials), how it is marketed and promoted (e.g., pencils and pens intended specifically for sketching and drawing are likely to be art materials), and where it is sold (e.g., products sold in an art supply store are likely to be art materials). The products described in this paragraph do not meet the statutory definition of \u201cart material.\u201d",
            "(2) Tools, implements, and furniture used in the creation of a work of art such as brushes, chisels, easels, picture frames, drafting tables and chairs, canvas stretchers, potter's wheels, hammers, air pumps for air brushes, kilns, and molds.",
            "(3) Surface materials upon which an art material is applied, such as coloring books and canvas, unless, as a result of processing or handling, the consumer is likely to be exposed to a chemical in or on the surface material in a manner which makes that chemical susceptible to being ingested, absorbed, or inhaled.",
            "(4) The following materials whether used as a surface or applied to one, unless, as a result of processing or handling, the consumer is likely to be exposed to a chemical in or on the surface material in a manner which makes that chemical susceptible to being ingested, absorbed, or inhaled: paper, cloth, plastics, films, yarn, threads, rubber, sand, wood, stone, tile, masonry, and metal.",
            "(B) For purposes of LHAMA enforcement policy, the Commission will enforce against materials including, but not limited to, paints, crayons, colored pencils, glues, adhesives, and putties, if such materials are sold as part of an art, craft, model, or hobby kit. The Commission will enforce the LHAMA requirements against paints or other materials sold separately which are intended to decorate art, craft, model, and hobby items. Adhesives, glues, and putties intended for general repair or construction uses are not subject to LHAMA. However, the Commission will enforce the LHAMA requirements against adhesives, glues, and putties sold separately (not part of a kit) if they are intended for art and craft and model construction uses. This paragraph (b)(8)(iv)(B) applies to products introduced into interstate commerce on or after August 14, 1995.",
            "(C) Commission regulations at \u00a7 1500.14(b)(8)(i)(C)(7) require that a statement of conformance appear with art materials that have been reviewed in accordance with the Commission standard. The Commission interprets this provision to require a conformance statement regardless of the presence of any chronic hazard warnings.",
            "(D) Nothing in this enforcement statement should be deemed to alter any of the requirements of the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (\u201cFHSA\u201d), such as, but not limited to, the requirement that any hazardous substance intended or packaged in a form suitable for household use must be labeled in accordance with section 2(p) of the FHSA."

            "(11)(i) Reloadable tube aerial shell fireworks devices that use shells larger than 1.75 inches in outer diameter and that are imported on or after October 8, 1991.",
            "(ii) Findings. (A) General. In order to issue a rule under section 2(q)(1) of the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (\u201cFHSA\u201d), 15 U.S.C. 1261(q)(1), classifying a substance or article as a banned hazardous substance, the FHSA requires the Commission to make certain findings and to include these findings in the regulation. These findings are discussed below.",
            "(B) Voluntary standard. Although a voluntary standard relating to the risk of injury associated with reloadable tube aerial shells has been adopted, it has not been implemented. Thus, the Commission is not required to make findings covering the likelihood that the voluntary standard would result in elimination or adequate reduction of the risk of injury or that there would be substantial compliance with the voluntary standard.",
            "(C) Relationship of benefits to costs. The Commission estimates that the removal of large reloadable shells from the market is likely to virtually eliminate the number of associated injuries, with only a slight offsetting increase in the number of injuries due to the use of substitute Class C fireworks products available to consumers. The estimated net benefits range from essentially zero to close to $1 million annually. The annual costs of a ban are estimated to be very low. Included are potential costs to foreign manufacturers and U.S. importers from sales losses, production changes, and inventory retrofitting, and slightly reduced market choices for consumers who purchase aerial display fireworks. Costs to each of these sectors are estimated to be slight, and are reduced to the extent that alternative products are perceived as adequate substitutes for large reloadable shells. Thus, the Commission finds that the benefits expected from the regulation bear a reasonable relationship to its costs.",
            "(D) Least burdensome requirement. The Commission considered several alternatives to the ban. These included: Design or performance criteria; additional or alternative labeling; inclusion of some reloadable shells 1.75 inches or smaller in the ban; and no action in reliance on the voluntary standard. The Commission determined that a ban of reloadable shells larger than 1.75 inches in outer diameter is the least burdensome alternative that would prevent or adequately reduce the risk of injury.",
            "(1) Regarding design or performance criteria, the Commission considered requirements similar to those stated in the voluntary standard of the American Fireworks Standards Laboratory (\u201cAFSL\u201d). However, such criteria may increase the cost of the product and would not address all factors involved in the incidents. Further, concerns exist about the feasibility of criteria and quality control.",
            "(2) Regarding additional or alternative labeling, the users' perception and experience concerning the amount of time available to get away may lead them to disregard an inconsistent warning. There are no data to suggest that a significant number, if any, incidents would be avoided if large reloadable shells carried more detailed labels or instructions than they currently do. It cannot be concluded that potential benefits would be greater than zero.",
            "(3) The Commission considered including reloadable shells that are 1.75 inches or less in outer diameter and have the \u201cequivalent explosive power\u201d of larger shells. A kinetic energy level of 70 joules was considered to evaluate explosive power. However, any potential benefits are uncertain since the Commission concluded that a clear relation between kinetic energy and injury potential could not be established. Also, costs could be slightly higher.",
            "(4) The Commission also considered imposing no mandatory requirements on large reloadable shells and relying instead on the AFSL voluntary standard. However, it is uncertain whether any net benefits to consumers would result from this alternative, since the level of injury reduction could be near zero if, as is probable, some firms chose not to conform with some or all of the AFSL standard.",
            "(12)(i) Large multiple-tube devices. Multiple-tube mine and shell fireworks devices that first enter commerce or are imported on or after March 26, 1997, that have any tube measuring 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) or more in inner diameter, and that have a minimum tip angle less than 60 degrees when tested in accordance with the procedure of \u00a7 1507.12 of this part.",
            "(ii) Findings\u2014(A) General. In order to issue a rule under the section 2(q)(1) of the FHSA, 15 U.S.C. 1261(q)(1), classifying a substance or article as a banned hazardous substance, the FHSA requires the Commission to make certain findings and to include these in the regulation. These findings are discussed in paragraphs (a)(12)(ii) (B) through (D) of this section.",
            "(B) Voluntary standard. (1) One alternative to the tip-angle requirement that the Commission considered is to take no mandatory action, and to depend on a voluntary standard. The American Fireworks Safety Laboratory (AFSL) has a standard for mines and shells intended to address the potential tip-over hazard associated with multiple-tube fireworks devices. AFSL's Voluntary Standard for Mines and Shells\u2014Single or Multiple Shot requires that large multiple-tube devices not tip over (except as the result of the last shot) when shot on a 2-inch thick medium-density foam pad. The Commission cannot conclude that AFSL's existing voluntary standard adequately reduces the risk of injury from large devices that tip over while functioning. The Commission's tests using polyurethane foam did not find sufficient agreement between performance on foam and on grass. No other data are available to show that this dynamic test is reliable.",
            "(2) In addition, even if the AFSL standard is effective, the Commission does not believe that compliance with the standard will be adequate. AFSL reports that it has been testing in accordance with its standard since January 1994. However, the results of CPSC's compliance testing indicate that multiple-tube devices still tip over while functioning. In fiscal year 1994, all 24 imported devices the Commission tested, and 1 of 8 domestic devices, tipped over while functioning. In fiscal year 1995, 22 of 27 imported devices and 1 of 5 domestic devices tipped over during Commission testing. The Commission finds that there is unlikely to be substantial compliance with the voluntary standard applicable to multiple-tube devices.",
            "(C) Relationship of benefits to costs. The Commission estimates that the 60-degree tip-angle standard will eliminate the unreasonable tip-over risk posed by these devices. This will provide benefits of saving one life about every 3 years, and preventing an unknown number of nonfatal injuries. The annual cost of modifying affected devices is estimated to be between $1.5 million and $2.7 million. The Commission finds that the benefits from the regulation bear a reasonable relationship to its costs.",
            "(D) Least burdensome requirement. The Commission considered the following alternatives: a ban of all multiple-tube devices with inner tube diameters 1.5 inches or greater; a dynamic performance standard; additional labeling requirements; and relying on the voluntary standard. Although a ban of all large multiple-tube devices would address the risk of injury, it would be more burdensome than the tip-angle standard. The Commission was unable to develop a satisfactory dynamic standard that would reduce the risk of injury. Neither additional labeling requirements nor reliance on the voluntary standard would adequately reduce the risk of injury. Thus, the Commission finds that a standard requiring large multiple-tube devices to have a minimum tip angle greater than 60 degrees is the least burdensome requirement that would prevent or adequately reduce the risk of injury.",
            "(13)(i) Candles made with metal-cored wicks. Candles manufactured or imported on or after October 15, 2003, made with metal-cored candlewicks, unless:",

            "(iii) Findings\u2014(A) General. To issue a rule under section 2(q)(1) of the FHSA, 15 U.S.C. 1261(q)(1), classifying a substance or article as a banned hazardous substance, the Commission must make certain findings and include them in the regulation. These findings are discussed in paragraphs (a)(13)(iii)(B) through (D) of this section.",
            "(B) Voluntary standard. One alternative to the ban that the Commission considered is to take no mandatory action, and to depend on a voluntary standard. One organization has a standard for candlewicks intended to address the potential for substantial illness posed by such wicks and candles with such wicks. The Commission has found that the standard is technically unsound and that substantial compliance with it is unlikely. Furthermore, there is no evidence that the standard has been adopted and implemented by candlewick or candle manufacturers.",
            "(C) Relationship of benefits to costs. The Commission estimates that the ban will reduce the potential for exposure to lead and resulting lead poisoning because there is no \u201csafe\u201d level of lead in the blood. The annual cost to the candle/wick industry of the ban is estimated by the Commission to be in the range of $100,000 to $300,000. On a percentage basis these costs represent only 0.005 to 0.015 percent of the overall value of candle shipments in 2000, which was approximately $2 billion. Accordingly, the Commission finds that the benefits from the regulation bear a reasonable relationship to its costs.",
            "(D) Least burdensome requirement. The Commission considered the following alternatives: no action; labeling all metal-cored candles with wicks containing more than 0.06 percent lead by weight of the metal; recordkeeping for shipments of wicks containing 0.06 percent or less lead by weight of the metal and of candles with such wicks; and relying on the voluntary standard. Neither no action, nor labeling, nor reliance on the voluntary standard would adequately reduce the risk of illness. Recordkeeping for shipments of wicks and of candles was not the least burdensome requirement that would prevent or adequately reduce the risk of illness. Therefore the Commission finds that a ban on candlewicks containing more than 0.06 percent lead by weight of the metal and candles with such wicks is the least burdensome requirement that would prevent or adequately reduce the risk of illness.",

            "(D) Least burdensome requirement. The Commission considered labeling and a design or performance standard as alternatives to the ban. The Commission does not believe that any form of labeling would have a significant effect in preventing the hazard associated with infant cushions.

Dive sticks and similar articles that come to rest underwater at an angle greater than 45 degrees from vertical when measured under the test at \u00a7 1500.86(a)(7) and dive sticks and similar articles that maintain a compressive force of less than 5-lbf under the test at \u00a7 1500.86(a)(8) are exempt from this banning rule. Articles that have a continuous circular shape, such as dive rings and dive disks are also exempt.",
            "(ii)(A) Findings. In order for the Commission to issue a rule under section 2(q)(1) of the FHSA classifying a substance or article as a banned hazardous substance, the Commission must make certain findings and include these findings in the regulation. 15 U.S.C. 1262(i)(2). These findings are discussed in paragraphs (a)(18)(ii)(B) through (D) of this section.",
            "(B) Voluntary standard. No findings concerning compliance with and adequacy of a voluntary standard are necessary because no relevant voluntary standard addressing the risk of injury posed by dive sticks has been adopted and implemented.",
            "(C) Relationship of benefits to costs. The Commission estimates the potential benefits of removing hazardous dive sticks from the market to be 2 to 4 cents per dive stick. With the availability of substitutes and the expected low cost of modifying dive sticks to conform to the rule, the Commission anticipates that necessary changes will be minimal. The Commission estimates that the costs of the rule will be no more than 2 to 4 cents per dive stick. Thus, the Commission finds that there is a reasonable relationship between the expected benefits of the rule and its costs.",
            "(D) Least burdensome requirement. The Commission considered pursuing voluntary recalls, following a voluntary standard, requiring labeling or changing the scope of the rule. A banning rule would be more effective than case-by-case recalls because the impalement hazard affects all dive sticks, not a specific brand or model. Awaiting recalls would allow these hazardous items on the market until the Commission obtained recalls. No applicable voluntary standard exists, and compliance may be low if one did. Although labeling could help reduce the risk of injuries from dive sticks, it would be less effective than a banning rule. It may be difficult for a label to convey the necessary information at the time of use. Modifying the scope so that the rule would only apply to pre-weighted dive sticks would continue to permit hazardous items because the unweighted dive sticks can easily be weighted to stand vertically at the bottom of the water. Thus, the Commission finds that a ban of dive sticks with the hazardous characteristics it has identified is the least burdensome alternative that would adequately reduce the risk of injury.",

Any signal word shall appear on the same line and in close proximity to the triangle required by section 24 of the act. Multiple messages should be provided with sufficient space between them, when feasible, to prevent them from visually blending together.",
            "(7) All labeling statements required by this section shall comply with the following type size requirements. 16 CFR 1500.121(c)(1) explains how to compute the area of the principal display panel and letter height.",
            "(8) Labeling required by this section that appears on a bin, container for retail display, or vending machine shall be in reasonable proximity to any pricing or product information contained on the principal display panel, or, if such information is not present, in close proximity to the article that is subject to the labeling requirements.",
            "(9) Descriptive material that accompanies a product subject to the labeling requirements, including accompanying material subject to the alternative allowed by \u00a7 1500.19(f), shall comply with the requirements of 16 CFR 1500.121(c)(6) relating to literature containing instructions for use which accompanies a hazardous substance. If the descriptive material contains instructions for use, the required precautionary labeling shall be in reasonable proximity to such instructions or directions and shall be placed together within the same general area (see 16 CFR 1500.121(c)(6)).",
            "(10) In the case of any alternative labeling statement permitted under \u00a7 1500.19(e), the requirements of 16 CFR 1500.121(b)(3) and 1500.121(c)(2)(iii) shall apply to statements or indicators on the principal display panel directing attention to the complete cautionary labeling that appears on another display panel.",
            "(11) Any triangle required by this section shall be an equilateral triangle. The height of such a triangle shall be equal to or exceed the height of the letters of the signal word \u201cWARNING\u201d. The height of the exclamation point inside the triangle shall be at least half the height of the triangle, and the exclamation point shall be centered vertically in the triangle. The triangle shall be separated from the signal word by a distance at least equal to the space occupied by the first letter of the signal word. In all other respects, triangles with exclamation points shall conform generally to the provisions of 16 CFR 1500.121 relating to signal words.",
            "(e) Combination of labeling statements. The labels of products that contain more than one item subject to the requirements of this section may combine information relating to each of the respective hazards, if the resulting condensed statement contains all of the information necessary to describe the hazard presented by each article. However, in the case of a product that contains a balloon and another item subject to the labeling requirements, only the signal word and statement of hazard may be combined.",
            "(f) Alternative labeling statements for small packages. Any cautionary statement required by section 1500.19(b) may be displayed on a display panel of the package of a product subject to the labeling requirement other than the principal display panel only if:",
            "(1) The package has a principal display panel of 15 square inches or less,",

A weight-of-evidence analysis, including any of the following: existing human and animal data, structure activity relationships, physicochemical properties; and chemical reactivity, or validated in vitro or in silico testing are recommended to evaluate existing information before in vivo tests are considered. If in vivo testing is conducted, a sequential testing strategy is recommended to reduce the number of test animals. The method of testing the toxic substances referred to in \u00a7 1500.3(c)(1) and (2) is as follows:",
            "(a) Acute dermal toxicity (single exposure). In the acute exposures, the agent is held in contact with the skin by means of a sleeve for periods varying up to 24 hours. The sleeve, made of rubber dam or other impervious material, is so constructed that the ends are reinforced with additional strips and should fit snugly around the trunk of the animal. The ends of the sleeve are tucked, permitting the central portion to \u201cballoon\u201d and furnish a reservoir for the dose. The reservoir must have sufficient capacity to contain the dose without pressure. In the following table are given the dimensions of sleeves and the approximate body surface exposed to the test substance. The sleeves may vary in size to accommodate smaller or larger subjects. In the testing of unctuous materials that adhere readily to the skin, mesh wire screen may be employed instead of the sleeve. The screen is padded and raised approximately 2 centimeters from the exposed skin. In the case of dry powder preparations, the skin and substance are moistened with physiological saline prior to exposure. The sleeve or screen is then slipped over the gauze that holds the dose applied to the skin. In the case of finely divided powders, the measured dose is evenly distributed on cotton gauze which is then secured to the area of exposure.",
            "(b) Preparation of test animal. The animals are prepared by clipping the skin of the trunk free of hair. Approximately one-half of the animals are further prepared by making epidermal abrasions every 2 or 3 centimeters longitudinally over the area of exposure. The abrasions are sufficiently deep to penetrate the stratum corneum (horny layer of the epidermis) but not to distrub the derma; that is, not to obtain bleeding.",
            "(c) Procedures for testing. The sleeve is slipped onto the animal which is then placed in a comfortable but immobilized position in a multiple animal holder. Selected doses of liquids and solutions are introduced under the sleeve. If there is slight leakage from the sleeve, which may occur during the first few hours of exposure, it is collected and reapplied. Dosage levels are adjusted in subsequent exposures (if necessary) to enable a calculation of a dose that would be fatal to 50 percent of the animals. This can be determined from mortality ratios obtained at various doses employed. At the end of 24 hours the sleeves or screens are removed, the volume of unabsorbed material (if any) is measured, and the skin reactions are noted. The subjects are cleaned by thorough wiping, observed for gross symptoms of poisoning, and then observed for 2 weeks."

The method of testing the dermal corrosivity and primary irritation of substances referred to in \u00a7 1500.3(c)(3) and (4), respectively, is a patch-test technique on the abraded and intact skin of the albino rabbit, clipped free of hair. Primary irritation to the skin is measured by a patch-test technique on the abraded and intact skin of the albino rabbit, clipped free of hair. A minimum of six subjects are used in abraded and intact skin tests. Introduce under a square patch, such as surgical gauze measuring 1 inch by 1 inch and two single layers thick, 0.5 milliliter (in the case of liquids) or 0.5 gram (in the case of solids and semisolids) of the test substance. Dissolve solids in an appropriate solvent and apply the solution as for liquids. The animals are immobilized with patches secured in place by adhesive tape. The entire trunk of the animal is then wrapped with an impervious material, such as rubberized cloth, for the 24-hour period of exposure. This material aids in maintaining the test patches in position and retards the evaporation of volatile substances. After 24 hours of exposure, the patches are removed and the resulting reactions are evaluated on the basis of the designated values in the following table:"

A weight-of-evidence analysis or a validated in vitro test method is recommended to evaluate existing information before in vivo tests are considered. This analysis should include any of the following: Existing human and animal data on ocular or dermal irritation, structure activity relationships, physicochemical properties, and chemical reactivity. If in vivo testing is conducted, a sequential testing strategy is recommended to reduce the number of test animals. Additionally, the routine use of topical anesthetics, systemic analgesics, and humane endpoints to avoid or minimize pain and distress in ocular safety testing is recommended.",
            "(a)(1) In the method of testing the ocular irritation of a substance referred to in \u00a7 1500.3(c)(4), six albino rabbits are used for each test substance. Animal facilities for such procedures shall be so designed and maintained as to exclude sawdust, wood chips, or other extraneous materials that might produce eye irritation. Both eyes of each animal in the test group shall be examined before testing, and only those animals without eye defects or irritation shall be used. The animal is held firmly but gently until quiet. The test material is placed in one eye of each animal by gently pulling the lower lid away from the eyeball to form a cup into which the test substance is dropped. The lids are then gently held together for one second and the animal is released. The other eye, remaining untreated, serves as a control. For testing liquids, 0.1 milliliter is used. For solids or pastes, 100 milligrams of the test substance is used, except that for substances in flake, granule, powder, or other particulate form the amount that has a volume of 0.1 milliliter (after compacting as much as possible without crushing or altering the individual particles, such as by tapping the measuring container) shall be used whenever this volume weighs less than 100 milligrams. In such a case, the weight of the 0.1 milliliter test dose should be recorded. The eyes are not washed following instillation of test material except as noted below.",
            "(2) The eyes are examined and the grade of ocular reaction is recorded at 24, 48, and 72 hours. Reading of reactions is facilitated by use of a binocular loupe, hand slit-lamp, or other expert means. After the recording of observations at 24 hours, any or all eyes may be further examined after applying fluorescein. For this optional test, one drop of fluorescein sodium ophthalmic solution U.S.P. or equivalent is dropped directly on the cornea. After flushing out the excess fluorescein with sodium chloride solution U.S.P. or equivalent, injured areas of the cornea appear yellow; this is best visualized in a darkened room under ultraviolet illumination. Any or all eyes may be washed with sodium chloride solution U.S.P. or equivalent after the 24-hour reading.",
            "(b)(1) An animal shall be considered as exhibiting a positive reaction if the test substance produces at any of the readings ulceration of the cornea (other than a fine stippling), or opacity of the cornea (other than a slight dulling of the normal luster), or inflammation of the iris (other than a slight deepening of the folds (or rugae) or a slight circumcorneal injection of the blood vessels), or if such substance produces in the conjunctivae (excluding the cornea and iris) an obvious swelling with partial eversion of the lids or a diffuse crimson-red with individual vessels not easily discernible.",
            "(2) The test shall be considered positive if four or more of the animals in the test group exhibit a positive reaction. If only one animal exhibits a positive reaction, the test shall be regarded as negative. If two or three animals a positive reaction, the test is repeated using a different group of six animals. The second test shall be considered positive if three or more of the animals exhibit a positive reaction. If only one or two animals in the second test exhibit a positive reaction, the test shall be repeated with a different group of six animals. Should a third test be needed, the substance will be regarded as an irritant if any animal exhibits a positive response.",

            "(a) Scope. (1) This method describes the test procedure which the Commission will use for the determination of the flashpoint of volatile flammable materials, using a Setaflash \n1\n low-range closed tester, or an apparatus producing equivalent results. The method described in this section is essentially a Setaflash equilibrium procedure which closely parallels the test method designated ASTM D 3828-81, \u201cStandard Test Methods for Flash Point by Setaflash Closed Tester,\u201d published by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), 1916 Race Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19103. Manufacturers and labelers of products subject to labeling and other requirements under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act may use other apparatus and/or test methods which produce equivalent results.",
            "(2) At the option of the user, the procedures described in this section may be used to determine the actual flashpoint temperature of a sample or to determine whether a product will or will not flash at a specified temperature (flash/no flash).",
            "(3) If the substance to be tested has a viscosity greater than 150 Stokes at 77 \u00b0F (25 \u00b0C), see paragraph (n) of this section for modifications to the testing procedure.",
            "(4) If the Commission has reason to believe on the basis of reliable experience or other relevant information or data that the flammability hazard of a substance is greater or less than its flammability classification based on flashpoint temperature determined in accordance with this \u00a7 1500.43a and that the substance should be reclassified, the Commission will initiate a rulemaking proceeding for reclassification of the substance. Product manufacturers and labelers may use reliable experience or other relevant information or data in addition to the flashpoint temperature of a substance as a basis for compliance with any applicable requirements of the Federal Hazardous Substances Act in the absence of a rule issued by the Commission to reclassify the substance.",
            "(b) Summary of test methods. (1) Method A\u2014Flash/No Flash Test. A specified volume of sample is introduced by a syringe into the cup of the apparatus that is set and maintained at the specified temperature. After a specific time a test flame is applied and an observation made as to whether or not a flash occurred. Test procedures are set forth in detail in \u00a7 1500.43a(i).",
            "(2) Method B\u2014Finite (or Actual) Flashpoint. (i) A specified voume of sample is introduced into the cup of the apparatus that is maintained at the expected flashpoint. After a specified time a test flame is applied and the observation made whether or not a flash occurred.",
            "(ii) The specimen is removed from the cup, the cup cleaned, and the cup temperature adjusted 5 \u00b0C (9 \u00b0F), lower or higher depending on whether or not a flash occurred previously. A fresh specimen is introduced and tested. This procedure is repeated until the flashpoint is established within 5 \u00b0C (9 \u00b0F).",
            "(iii) The procedure is then repeated at 1 \u00b0C (2 \u00b0F) intervals until the flashpoint is determined to the nearest 1 \u00b0C (2 \u00b0F).",
            "(iv) If improved accuracy is desired the procedure is repeated at 0.5 \u00b0C (1 \u00b0F). Test procedures are set forth in detail at \u00a7 1500.43a(j).",
            "(3) The test procedures will be modified, where necessary, to ensure that the results obtained reflect the hazard of the substance under reasonably foreseeable conditions of use. Thus, for example, the material, if a mixture, will normally be tested as it comes from the container, and/or after a period of evaporation. The period of evaporation for a material which is a mixture will normally be the time required for the mixture to evaporate in an open beaker under ambient conditions to 90 percent of its original volume, or a period of four hours, whichever occurs first. However, this period of evaporation will be changed if the results obtained do not represent the hazard of the substance under reasonably foreseeable conditions of use.",
            "(c) Definition of flashpoint. The lowest temperature of the sample, corrected to a barometric pressure of 101.3 kPa (760 mm Hg), at which application of a test flame causes the vapor of the sample to ignite under specified conditions of test. The sample is deemed to have flashed when a large flame appears and instantaneously propagates itself over the surface of the sample. Occasionally, particularly near actual flashpoint, the application of the test flame will cause a halo or an enlarged flame; this is not a flash and should be ignored.",
            "(d) Test apparatus. The test apparatus is an equilibrium closed-cup tester with a range up to 100 \u00b0C (212 \u00b0F). The essential dimensions and requirements are shown in figure 1 and table 3, and are described in \u00a7 1500.43a(m). Closed-cup flashpoint testers and accessories meeting these requirements are available from commercial suppliers and distributors of laboratory equipment.",
            "(e) Safety precautions. The operator must exercise and take appropriate safety precautions during the initial application of the test flame to the sample. Samples containing low-flash material may give an abnormally strong flash when the test flame is first applied.",
            "(f) Preparation of samples. (1) Erroneously high flashpoints may be obtained if precautions are not taken to avoid the loss of volatile material. In preliminary tests of materials taken directly from the container, do not open containers unnecessarily and make a transfer unless the sample temperature is at least 10 \u00b0C (18 \u00b0F) below the expected flashpoint. Do not use samples in leaky containers for this test.",
            "(2) Do not store samples in plastic (polyethylene, polypropylene, etc.) bottles since volatile material may diffuse through the walls of the bottle.",
            "(3) A 2-ml specimen is required for each test. If possible, obtain at least a 50-ml sample from the bulk test site and store in a clean, tightly closed container.",
            "(g) Preparation of apparatus. (1) Place the tester on a level, stable surface. Unless tests are made in a draft-free area, surround the tester on three sides with a shield for protection. Do not rely on tests made in a laboratory draft hood or near ventilators.",
            "(2) Read the manufacturer's instructions on the care and servicing of the instrument and for correct operation of its controls.",
            "(h) Calibration and standardization. (1) Before initial use determine and plot the relationship between the temperature control dial and the thermometer readings at each major (numbered) dial division as follows:",
            "Turn the temperature control knob \n2\n fully counterclockwise (\u201cO\u201d reading). Advance the temperature control knob clockwise until the indicator light is illuminated. \n3\n Advance the knob clockwise to the next numbered line. After the thermometer mercury column ceases to advance, record the dial reading and the temperature. Advance the knob clockwise to the next numbered line. After the thermometer mercury column ceases to advance, read the dial reading and the temperature. Repeat this procedure through the full range of the instrument. Plot the dial readings versus the respective temperatures.",
            "(2) Standardize the instrument using a sample of material meeting the specifications in table 1. If the average of two determinations falls within the acceptable limits the instrument is assumed to be operating properly. If the average of the two determinations does not fall within this range, check the manufacturer's operating and maintenance instructions and determine that they are being followed. In particular, be sure that the cup lid assembly makes a vapor-tight seal with the cup, the shutter provides a light-tight seal, and that adequate heat transfer paste surrounds the thermometer bulb and the immersed portion of the barrel.",
            "(i) Test Method A\u2014for determining Flash/No Flash. (1) Determine the target flashpoint as follows:",
            "(i) Target flashpoint, \u00b0C = Sc\u20140.25 (101.3\u2014A)",
            "(ii) Target flashpoint, \u00b0C = Sc\u20140.03 (760-B)",
            "(iii) Target flashpoint, \u00b0F = Sf\u20140.06 (760-B)",
            "(2) Inspect the inside of the sample cup, lid, and shutter mechanism for cleaniness and freedom from contamination. Use an absorbent paper tissue to wipe clean, if necessary. Put cover in place and lock securely. The filing orifice may be convenienty cleaned with a pipe cleaner.",
            "(3) Set the instrument at the target temperature.",
            "(i) For target temperature below ambient. The instrument power switch is to be in the off position. Fill the refigerant-charged cooling block with a suitable material. \n5\n Raise the lid and shutter assembly, and position the base of the block in the sample cup, being careful not to injure or mar the cup. When the thermometer reads approximately 6 to 10 \u00b0C (10 to 20 \u00b0F) below the target temperature, remove the cooling block and quickly dry the cup with a paper tissue to remove any moisture. Immediately close the lid and shutter assembly and secure. Prepare to introduce the sample using the syringe, both of which have been precooled to a temperature 5 to 10 \u00b0C (10 to 20 \u00b0F) below the target temperature.",
            "(A) Caution: Do not cool the sample block below \u221238 \u00b0C, the freezing point of mercury.",
            "(B) Caution: Acetone is extremely flammable. Keep away from heat, sparks, and flames and keep container closed when not actually pouring acetone. Use only in a well-ventilated area. Avoid inhalation and contact with the eyes or skin. Use cloth or leather gloves, goggles or safety shield, and keep dry ice in a canvas bag, especially when cracking.",
            "(ii) For target temperature above ambient. Switch the instrument on and turn the coarse temperature control knob fully clockwise (full on) causing the indicator light to illuminate. \n6\n When the thermometer indicates a temperature about 3 \u00b0C (5 \u00b0F) below the target (or specification) temperature, reduce the heat input to the sample cup by turning the coarse temperature control knob counter-clockwise to the desired control point (see \u00a7 1500.43a(i)(1)). When the indicator light slowly cycles on and off read the temperature on the thermometer. If necessary, adjust the fine (center) temperature control knob to obtain the desired test (target) temperature. When the test temperature is reached and the indicator lamp slowly cycles on and off, prepare to introduce the sample.",
            "(4) Charge the syringe with a 2-ml specimen of the sample \n7\n to be tested; transfer the syringe to the filling orifice, taking care not to lose any sample; discharge the test specimen into the cup by fully depressing the syringe plunger, remove the syringe.",
            "(5)(i) Set the timer \n8\n by rotating its knob clockwise to its stop. Open the gas control valve and light the pilot and test flames. Adjust the test flame with the pinch valve to conform to the size of the 4-mm (5/32-in.) gage.",
            "(ii) After the time signal indicates the specimen is at test temperature \n8, apply the test flame by slowly and uniformly opening the shutter and closing it completely over a period of approximately 2\n1/2 s. \n9\n Watch closely for a flash at the cup openings.",
            "(iii) The sample is deemed to have flashed when a large flame appears and instantaneously propagates itself over the surface of the sample (see \u00a7 1500.43a(c)).",
            "(6) Record the test results as \u201cflash\u201d or \u201cno flash\u201d and the test temperature.",
            "(7) Turn off the pilot and test flames using the gas control valve. Remove the sample and clean the instrument. It may be necessary to allow the cup temperature to decline to a safe level before cleaning.",
            "(j) Test Method B\u2014for determining Finite or Actual Flashpoint. (1) Inspect the inside of the sample cup, lid, and shutter mechanism for cleanliness and freedom from contamination. Use an absorbent paper tissue to wipe clean, if necessary. Put cover in place and lock securely. The filling orifice may be conveniently cleaned with a pipe cleaner.",
            "(2) For expected flashpoints below ambient. (i) The instrument power switch is to be in off position. Fill the refrigerant-charged cooling block with a suitable material. \n5 Raise the lid and shutter assembly, and position the base of the block in the sample cup, being careful not to injure or mar the cup. When the thermometer reaches a temperature 5 to 10 \u00b0C (10 to 20 \u00b0F) below the expected flashpoint, remove the cooling block and quickly dry the cup with a paper tissue to remove any moisture. Immediately close the lid and shutter assembly and secure. Prepare to introduce the sample using the syringe, both of which have been precooled to a temperature 5 to 10 \u00b0C (10 to 20 \u00b0F) below the expected temperature (See \u00a7 1500.43a(j)(5)).",
            "(ii) Caution: Do not cool the sample block below \u221238 \u00b0C, the freezing point of mercury.",
            "(3) For tests where the expected flashpoint is above ambient. Turn the coarse temperature control knob fully clockwise (full on) causing the indicator light to illuminate. When the thermometer reaches a temperature 3 \u00b0C (5 \u00b0F) below the estimated flashpoint, turn the coarse temperature knob counter-clockwise to the dial reading representing the estimated flashpoint temperature as shown on the calibration curve (See \u00a7 1500.43a(h)(1)). When the indicator light slowly cycles on and off, read the temperature on the thermometer. If necessary, adjust the fine temperature control knob to obtain the exact desired temperature.",
            "(4)(i) Charge the syringe \n7 with a 2 ml specimen of the sample \n7 to be tested; transfer the syringe to the filling orifice, taking care not to lose any sample; discharge the test specimen into the cup by fully depressing the syringe plunger; remove the syringe.",

If no flash is observed, the temperature recorded in \u00a7 1500.43a(j)(7), is the flashpoint to the nearest 0.5 \u00b0C (1 \u00b0F). If a flash is observed at the lower temperature, record this latter temperature as the flashpoint.",
            "(9) Turn off the pilot and test flames using the gas control valve. When the cup temperature declines to a safe level, remove the sample and clean the instrument.",
            "(k) Calculations. If it is desired to correct the observed finite flashpoint for the effect of barometric pressure, proceed as follows: Observe and record the ambient barometric pressure \n4 at the time of the test.

            "(ii) The cover is fitted with an opening slide and a device capable of inserting an ignition flame (diameter 4\u00b10.5 mm) into the well when the slide device shall intersect the plane of the underside of the cover. The cover is also provided with an orifice extending into the sample well for insertion of the test sample and also a suitable clamping device for securing the cover tightly to the metal block. The three openings in the cover shall be within the diameter of the sample well. When the slide is in the open position, the two openings in the slide shall coincide exactly with the two corresponding openings in the cover.",
            "(iii) Electrical heaters are attached to the bottom of the cup in a manner that provides efficient transfer of heat. An electronic heat control is required to hold the equilibrium temperature, in a draft-free area, within 0.1 \u00b0C (0.2 \u00b0F) for the low-temperature tester.

            "(3) Insertion depth for accessibility. (i) For any hole, recess, or opening having a minor dimension (The minor dimension of an opening is the diameter of the largest sphere that will pass through the opening.) smaller than the collar diameter of the appropriate probe, the total insertion depth for accessibility shall be up to the collar on the appropriate probe. Each probe joint may be rotated up to 90 degrees to simulate knuckle movement.",

            "(d) Sharp point test method\u2014(1) Principle of operation. The principle of operation of the sharp point tester shown in figure 1 of this section is as follows (Detailed engineering drawings for a suggested sharp point tester are available from the Commission's Office of the Secretary.): A rectangular opening measuring 0.040 inch (1.02 millimeters) wide by 0.045 inch (1.15 millimeters) long in the end of the slotted cap establishes two reference dimensions. Depth of penetration of the point being tested determines sharpness. If the point being tested can contact a sensing head that is recessed a distance of 0.015 inch (0.38 millimeter) below the end cap and can move the sensing head a further 0.005 inch (0.12 millimeter) against a 0.5-pound (2.2-newton) force of a return spring, the point shall be identified as sharp. A sharp point tester of the general configuration shown in figure 1 of this section or one yielding equivalent results shall identify a sharp point. In conducting tests to determine the presence of sharp points, the Commission will use the sharp point tester shown in figure 1 of this section and the accessibility probes designated as A or B in figure 2 of this section.",
            "(2) Procedure. (i) The sample to be tested shall be held in such a manner that it does not move during the test.",
            "(ii) Part of the test sample may need to be removed to allow the sharp point testing device to test a point that is accessible by the criteria of paragraph (c) of this section. Such dismantling of the test sample could affect the rigidity of the point in question. The sharp point test shall be performed with the point supported so that its stiffness approximates but is not greater than the point stiffness in the assembled sample.",
            "(iii) Using the general configuration shown in figure 1 of this section, the adjustment and operation of the sharp point tester is as follows: Hold the sharp point tester and loosen the lock ring by rotating it so that it moves towards the indicator lamp assembly a sufficient distance to expose the calibration reference marks on the barrel. Rotate the gaging can clockwise until the indicator lamp lights. Rotate the cap counterclockwise until an equivalent of five divisions (the distance between the short lines on the cap) have passed the calibration reference mark. Lock the gaging cap in this position by rotating the lock ring until it fits firmly against the cap. Insert the point into the gaging slot in all directions in which it was accessible by the criteria of paragraph (c) of this section, and apply a force of 1.00 pound (4.45 newtons). A glowing light identifies the point as sharp.",
            "(iv) The test instruments used by the Commission in its tests for compliance with this regulation shall have gaging slot opening dimensions no greater than 0.040 inch by 0.045 inch and shall have the sensing head recessed a depth of no less than 0.015 inch. The force applied by the Commission when inserting a point into the gaging slot shall be no more than 1.00 pound.",

(i) For any hole, recess, or opening having a minor dimension (the minor dimension of an opening is the diameter of the largest sphere that will pass through the opening), smaller than the collar diameter of the appropriate probe, the total insertion depth for accessibility shall be up to the collar on the appropriate probe. Each probe joint may be rotated up to 90 degrees to simulate knuckle movement.",
            "(ii) For any hole, recess, or opening having a minor dimension larger than the collar diameter of Probe A, but less than 7.36 inches (186.9 millimeters), when Probe A is used, or a minor dimension larger than the collar diameter of Probe B, but less than 9.00 inches (228.6 millimeters), when Probe B is used, the total insertion depth for accessibility shall be determined by inserting the appropriate probe with the extension, shown in Figure 2, in any direction up to 2\n1/4 times the minor dimension of the hole, recess, or opening, measured from any point in the plane of the opening. Each probe joint may be rotated up to 90 degrees to simulate knuckle movement.",

In such instances, the appropriate paragraphs (c)(3) (i) or (ii) of this section shall be followed. If both probes are to be used, a minor dimension that is 7.36 inches (186.9 millimeters or larger shall determine unrestricted access.",
            "(4) Inaccessible edges. Metal or glass edges shall be considered inaccessible without testing with a probe if they lie adjacent to a surface of the test sample, and any gap between the edge and the adjacent surface does not exceed 0.020 inch (0.50 millimeter) both before and after the tests of \u00a7\u00a7 1500.51, 1500.52, and 1500.53 (excluding the bite test\u2014paragraph (c) of each section) are performed. For example, in a lap joint in which a metal edge is overlapped by a parallel surface, any burr or feather-edge on the side closest to the protecting parallel surface is considered inaccessible if the gap between the edge and the parallel surface is no greater than 0.020 inch (0.50 millimeter). As an additional example, when sheet metal has a hemmed edge a portion of the sheet adjacent to the edge is folded back upon itself, approximately 180 degrees, so that it is roughly parallel to the main sheet. Any burrs or feathering on the inside edge, the side closest to the protecting parallel surface of the main sheet, will be considered inaccessible if the gap between the inside edge and the parallel surface does not exceed 0.020 inch (0.50 millimeter).",
            "(d) Sharp edge test method\u2014(1) Principle of operation. The test shall be performed with a sharp edge tester which contains a cylindrical mandrel capable of rotation at a constant velocity. (Engineering drawings for a suitable portable sharp edge test instrument are available from the Commission's Office of the Secretary.) The full circumference of the mandrel shall be wrapped with a single layer of polytetrafluoroethylene (TFE) tape as specified in paragraph (e)(3) of this section. The mandrel shall be applied to the edge to be tested with a normal force of 1.35 pounds (6.00 Newtons) such that the edge contacts the approximate center of the width of the tape as shown in Figure 1 of this section. The mandrel shall be rotated through one complete revolution while maintaining the force against the edge constant. Linear motion of the mandrel along the line of the edge shall be prevented. The edge shall be identified as sharp if it completely cuts through the tape for a length of not less than \n1/2 inch (13 millimeters) at any force up to 1.35 pounds (6.00 Newtons).",
            "(2) Procedure. (i) The edge of the sample to be tested shall be held in such a manner that it does not move during the test. If the full mandrel force of 1.35 pounds (6.00 Newtons) causes the edge to bend, a reduced mandrel force may be used.",
            "(ii) Part of the test sample may need to be removed to allow the sharp edge testing device to test an edge that is accessible by the criteria of paragraph (c) of this section. Such dismantling of the test sample could affect the rigidity of the edge in question. The sharp edge test shall be performed with the edge supported so that its stiffness approximates but is not greater than the edge stiffness in the assembled sample.",
            "(iii) Conduct of a sharp edge test is as follows: Wrap one layer of polytetrafluoroethylene (TFE) tape, described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, around the full circumference of the mandrel in an unstretched state. The ends of the tape shall be either butted or overlapped not more than 0.10 inch (2.5 millimeters). Apply the mandrel, at the approximate center of the tape, to the edge of the test sample with a force of 1.35 pounds (6.00 Newtons) measured in a direction at right angles to the mandrel axis. The mandrel shall be placed so that its axis is at 90 degrees \u00b15 degrees to the line of a straight test edge or 90 degrees \u00b15 degrees to a tangent at the point of contact with a curved test edge. The point of contact between the test edge and the mandrel shall be in the approximate center of the width of the tape. The axis of the mandrel may be positioned anywhere in a plane which is at right angles to either the line of a straight test edge or to a tangent at the point of contact with a curved test edge. The operator should seek the orientation most likely to cause the edge to cut the tape. Maintain the force against the edge and rotate the mandrel through one complete revolution while preventing any linear motion of the mandrel along the edge. Release the mandrel from the edge and remove the tape without enlarging any cut or causing any score to become a cut. A cut in the tape with a length of not less than \n1/2 inch (13 millimeters) identifies an edge as sharp. (The test instruments used by the Commission in its test for compliance with the regulation will be calibrated to insure that the force with which the mandrel is applied to a test edge does not exceed 1.35 pounds.)",
            "(e) Specifications for sharp edge test equipment. The following specifications shall apply to the equipment to be used in the sharp edge test described in paragraph (d) of this section:",
            "(1) The rotation of the mandrel shall produce a constant tangential velocity of 1.00\u00b10.08 inch per second (25.4\u00b12.0 millimeters per second) during the center 75 percent of its rotation and shall have a smooth start and stop.",
            "(2) The mandrel shall be made of steel. The test surface of the mandrel shall be free of scratches, nicks, or burrs and shall have a surface roughness no greater than 16 microinches (0.40 micron). The test surface shall have a hardness no less than 40 as measured on the Rockwell \u201cC\u201d scale, as determined pursuant to ASTM E 18-74 entitled \u201cStandard Test Methods for Rockwell Hardness and Rockwell Superficial Hardness of Metallic Materials,\u201d published July 1974 and which is incorporated by reference in this regulation. (Copies are available from American Society for Testing and Materials, 1916 Race Street, Philadelphia, Pa. 19103.) The diameter of the mandrel shall be 0.375\u00b10.005 inch (9.35\u00b10.12 millimeters). The mandrel shall be of suitable length to carry out the test.",
            "(3) The tape shall be pressure-sensitive polytetrafluoroethylene (TFE) high temperature electrical insulation tape as described in Military Specification MIL-I-23594B (1971) which is incorporated by reference in this regulation. (Copies are available from Naval Publications and Forms Center, 5801 Tabor Ave., Philadelphia, Pa. 19120.) The thickness of the polytetrafluoroethylene backing shall be between 0.0026 inch (0.066 millimeter) and 0.0035 inch (0.089 millimeter). \n1\n The adhesive shall be pressure-sensitive silicone polymer with a nominal thickness of 0.003 inch (.08 millimeter). The width of the tape shall not be less than \n1/4 inch (6 millimeters). While conducting sharp edge tests the temperature of the tape shall be maintained between 70 \u00b0F (21.1 \u00b0C) and 80 \u00b0F (26.6 \u00b0C).",

            "(a) The Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act provides for specific lead limits in children's products. Section 101(a) of the CPSIA provides that by February 10, 2009, products designed or intended primarily for children 12 and younger may not contain more than 600 ppm of lead. After August 14, 2009, products designed or intended primarily for children 12 and younger cannot contain more than 300 ppm of lead. On August 14, 2011, the limit may be further reduced to 100 ppm, unless the Commission determines that it is not technologically feasible to have this lower limit. Paint, coatings or electroplating may not be considered a barrier that would make the lead content of a product inaccessible to a child. Materials used in products intended primarily for children 12 and younger that are treated or coated with paint or similar surface-coating materials that are subject to 16 CFR part 1303, must comply with the requirements for lead paint under section 14(a) of the Consumer Product Safety Act (CPSA), as amended by section 102(a) of the CPSIA.",

            "(a)(1) Background and scope. Section 2(p)(1) of the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (FHSA) or \u201cthe Act\u201d), 15 U.S.C. 1261(p)(1), requires that hazardous substances bear certain cautionary statements on their labels. These statements include: signal words; affirmative statements of the principal hazard(s) associated with a hazardous substance; the common or usual name, or chemical name, of the hazardous substance; the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, distributor, or seller; statements of precautionary measures to follow; instructions, when appropriate, for special handling and storage; the statement \u201cKeep Out of the Reach of Children\u201d or its practical equivalent; and, when appropriate, first-aid instructions. Section 2(p)(2) of the Act specifies that all such statements shall be located prominently on the label of such a substance and shall appear in conspicuous and legible type in contrast by typography, layout, or color with other printed matter on the label. This regulation contains the Commission's interpretations and policies for the type size and placement of cautionary material on the labels of hazardous substances and contains other criteria for such cautionary statements that are acceptable to the Commission as satisfying section 2(p)(2) of the Act. Labels that do not comply with this regulation may be considered misbranded.",
            "(2) Definitions. For the purposes of this section:",
            "(i) Container means the immediate package from which a hazardous substance may be dispensed and also any article, package or wrapping, such as a tube or cone used for a firework or a wet cell battery casing containing sulfuric acid, which is necessary for the substance to function during actual use.",
            "(ii) Cautionary material, cautionary labeling, and cautionary labeling required by the Act mean all items of labeling information required by sections 2(p)(1) of the FHSA (repeated in 16 CFR 1500.3(b)(14)(i) or by the regulations which require additional labeling under section 3(b) of the Act.",
            "(iii) Display panel means any surface of the immediate container, and of any outer container or wrapping, which bears labeling.",
            "(iv) Principal display panel means the portion(s) of the surface of the immediate container, and of any outer container or wrapping, which bear(s) the labeling designed to be most prominently displayed, shown, presented, or examined under conditions of retail sale. (See paragraph (c)(1) of this section.)",
            "(v) Type size means the actual height of the printed image of each upper case or capital letter as it appears on the label of a hazardous substance. (See paragraph (c)(2) of this section.)",
            "(vi) Signal word means the appropriate word \u201cDANGER,\u201d \u201cWARNING,\u201d or \u201cCAUTION,\u201d as required by sections 2(p)(1) (C) or (D) of the Act.",
            "(vii) Statement of principal hazard(s) means that wording descriptive of the principal or primary hazard(s) associated with a hazardous substance required by section 2(p)(1)(E) of the Act. Some examples of such statements are \u201cHARMFUL OR FATAL IF SWALLOWED,\u201d \u201cVAPOR HARMFUL,\u201d \u201cFLAMMABLE,\u201d and \u201cSKIN AND EYE IRRITANT.\u201d",
            "(viii) Other cautionary material means all labeling statements, other than \u201csignal words\u201d or \u201cstatement(s) of principal hazard(s),\u201d required by the Act or by regulations issued under the Act.",
            "(b) Prominent label placement. To satisfy the requirement of the Act that cautionary labeling statements shall appear \u201cprominently\u201d on the label of a hazardous substance, all such statements shall be placed on the label as follows:",
            "(1) Horizontal placement of labeling statements. Except for the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, distributor, or seller, all cautionary material required by the Act shall appear in lines that are generally parallel to any base on which the package rests as it is designed to be displayed for sale or, on display panels other than the principal display panel, in lines generally parallel to all other labeling on that panel. This requirement does not apply to labeling on collapsible tubes, cylindrical containers with a narrow diameter, or F-type containers where both the \u201cfront\u201d and \u201cback\u201d of the container are principal display panels. (See paragraph (e) of this section.)",
            "(2) Principal display panel labeling. (i) All items of cautionary labeling required by the Act may appear on the principal display panel on the immediate container and, if appropriate, on any other container or wrapper. See paragraph (b)(4) of this section for requirements and exceptions for labeling outer containers and wrappings.",
            "(ii) The signal word, the statement of principal hazard(s), and, if appropriate, instructions to read carefully any cautionary material that may be placed elsewhere on the label shall be blocked together within a square or rectangular area, with or without a border, on the principal display panel on the immediate container and, where required by paragraph (b)(4) of this section, on any outer container or wrapping. All cautionary statements placed on the principal display panel shall be separated on all sides from other printed or graphic matter, with the exception of the declaration of net contents required under the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act, 15 U.S.C. 1453(a) (2) and (3), by a border line or by a space no smaller than the minimum allowable height of the type size for cautionary material required by the Act (exclusive of signal words and statements of hazard) on the principal display panel.",
            "(iii) Depending on the design of the package or the configuration of the label, or both, a package may have more than one principal display panel. If so, each principal display panel must bear, at a minimum, the signal word, statement of principal hazard or hazards, and, if appropriate, instructions to read carefully any cautionary material that may be placed elsewhere on the label.",
            "(A) Where the principal display panel of the immediate container consists of a lid, cap, or other item which may be separated from the immediate container and discarded, the container shall be deemed to have a second principal display panel elsewhere on the immediate container which must bear, at a minimum, the signal word, statement of principal hazard(s), and instructions, if appropriate, to read any cautionary material which may be placed elsewhere on the label.",
            "(3) Prominent label placement\u2014other display panel labeling. All items of cautionary labeling required by the Act which do not appear on the principal display panel shall be placed together on a display panel elsewhere on the container. The name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, distributor, or seller may appear separately on any display panel. Where cautionary material appears on a display panel other than the principal display panel, the principal display panel shall bear the statement \u201cRead carefully other cautions on the ___ panel,\u201d or its practical equivalent. [A description of the location of the other panel is to be inserted in the blank space.]",
            "(4) Outer container or wrappings. All cautionary labeling appearing on the immediate container of a hazardous substance shall also appear on any outer container or wrapping used in the retail display of the substance, in the same manner as required for the immediate container. Those cautionary labeling statements appearing on the immediate container which are clearly legible through any outer container or wrapper used in retail display need not appear on the outer container or wrapping itself. (See section 2(n)(1) of the Act.)",
            "(5) Placement of the word \u201cPoison\u201d and the skull and crossbones symbol. The word \u201cpoison\u201d and, when appropriate, the skull and crossbones symbol shall appear on the label of a hazardous substance as follows:",
            "(i) If a hazardous substance is \u201chighly toxic,\u201d as defined in \u00a7 1500.3(c)(i) and section 2(h)(1) of the FHSA, the label must bear the word \u201cpoison\u201d in accordance with section 2(p)(1)(H) of the Act, in addition to the signal word \u201cDANGER,\u201d and must also bear the skull and crossbones symbol. Some products, under \u00a7 1500.14(b) of the regulations, may, in addition to any required signal word, be required to bear the word \u201cpoison\u201d and the skull and crossbones symbol because of the special hazard associated with their ingredients. In both instances, the word \u201cpoison\u201d and the skull and crossbones symbol need not appear on the principal display panel on the container, unless all other cautionary labeling required by the Act appears on the principal display panel. The word \u201cpoison\u201d and the skull and crossbones symbol, when required, must appear either together with other cautionary labeling on a display panel other than the principal display panel or together with the signal word and statement(s) of principal hazard on the principal display panel.",
            "(ii) Where, pursuant to a regulation issued under section 3(b) of the Act, the label of a hazardous substance requires the word \u201cpoison\u201d instead of a signal word, the word, \u201cPOISON\u201d shall appear in capital letters on the principal display panel, together with the statement(s) of the principal hazard. Certain substances for which the word \u201cpoison\u201d is required instead of any signal word are listed in \u00a7 1500.129.",
            "(c) Conspicuousness\u2014type size and style. To satisfy the requirement that cautionary labeling statements under the Act be conspicuous and legible, such statements shall conform to the following requirements:",
            "(1) Area of principal display panel. The area of the principal display panel is the area of the side or surface of the immediate container, or of the side or surface of any outer container or wrapping, that bears the labeling designed to be most prominently displayed, shown, presented, or examined under conditions of retail sale. This area is not limited to the portion of the surface covered with labeling; rather, it includes the entire surface. Flanges at the tops and bottoms of cans, conical shoulders of cans, handles, and shoulders and necks of bottles and jars are excluded in measuring the area. For the purposes of determining the proper type size for cautionary labeling, the area of the principal display panel (or other panel bearing cautionary labeling, under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section) is to be computed as follows:",
            "(i) In the case of a rectangular package, where one entire side is the principal display panel, the product of the height times the width of that side shall be the area of the principal display panel.",
            "(ii) In the case of a cylindrical or nearly cylindrical container or tube on which the principal display panel appears on the side, the area of the principal display panel shall be 40 percent of the product of the height of the container times its circumference.",
            "(iii) In the case of any other shape of container, the area of the principal display panel shall be 40 percent of the total surface of the container, excluding those areas, such as flanges at tops and bottoms, specified in paragraph (c)(1) above. However, if such a container presents an obvious principal display panel (such as an oval or hour-glass shaped area on the side of a container for dishwashing detergent), the area to be measured shall be the entire area of the obvious principal display panel.",
            "(2) Type-size requirements. (i) The term type size refers to the height of the actual printed image of each upper case or capital letter as it appears on the label. The size of cautionary labeling shall be reasonably related to the type size of any other printing appearing on the same panel, but in any case must meet the minimum size requirements in table 1.",
            "(ii) When an item of labeling is required to be in a specified type size, all upper case, or capital, letters must be at least equal in height to the required type size, and all other letters must be the same style as the upper case or capital letters. Unless otherwise specified in the regulations (examples appear at \u00a7\u00a7 1500.14(b)(6), 1512.19, 1508.9, and part 1505), the type size of all cautionary statements appearing on any display panel shall comply with the specifications in table 1 when the area of the display panel is measured by the method in paragraph (c)(1) above:",
            "(iii) If all of the required cautionary labeling does not appear on the principal display panel, the statement to \u201cRead carefully other cautions on the ___ panel,\u201d or its practical equivalent, must appear in, as a minimum, the same type size as that required in table 1 for the other cautionary material which appears elsewhere on the label of a hazardous substance. The size of the cautionary labeling that does not appear on the principal display panel is determined by the area of the panel on which it does appear.",
            "(3) Type style\u2014proportion. The ratio of the height of a capital or uppercase letter to its width shall be such that the height of the letter is no more than 3 times its width.",
            "(4) Signal word and statements of hazard\u2014capital letters. The signal word, the word \u201cpoison\u201d if required instead of a signal word (see \u00a7 1500.129), and the statement of principal hazard or hazards shall be in capital letters.",
            "(5) Multiple statement of hazard\u2014type size and style. All statements of principal hazard or hazards on a label shall appear in the same size and style of type, and shall appear in the same color or have the same degree of boldness.",
            "(6) Accompanying literature containing directions for use. Where literature accompanying the package of a hazardous substance has directions for use, written or otherwise, section 2(n) of the Act requires the literature to bear cautionary labeling.",
            "(i) All such cautionary labeling shall be in reasonable proximity to any direction for use and shall be placed together within the same general area.",
            "(ii) The type size of such cautionary labeling shall be reasonably related to the type size of any other printed matter in the accompanying literature and must be in conspicuous and legible type by typography, layout, or color with other printed matter on the label. The signal word and statement of principal hazard or hazards shall appear in capital letters.",
            "(d) Conspicuousness\u2014contrast. To satisfy the requirement that cautionary labeling statements appear in conspicuous and legible type which is in contrast by typography, layout, or color with the other printed matter on the label, such statements shall conform to the following requirements:",
            "(1) Color. Where color is the primary method used to achieve appropriate contrast, the color of any cautionary labeling statement shall be in sharp contrast with the color of the background upon which such a statement appears. Examples of combinations of colors which may not satisfy the requirement for sharp contrast are: black letters on a dark blue or dark green background, dark red letters on a light red background, light red letters on a reflective silver background, and white letters on a light gray or tan background.",
            "(2) Interference with conspicuousness\u2014labeling design, vignettes, or other printed material. For cautionary information appearing on panels other than the principal display panel, the label design, the use of vignettes, or the proximity of other labeling or lettering shall not be such that any cautionary labeling statement is obscured or rendered inconspicuous.",
            "(e) Collapsible metal tubes. Collapsible metal tubes containing hazardous substances shall be labeled so that all cautionary labeling required by the Act appears as close to the dispensing end of the container as possible. The placement and conspicuousness of these statements shall conform to the provisions of paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section.",
            "(f) Unpackaged hazardous substances. Where practicable, unpackaged hazardous substances intended, or distributed in a form suitable, for use in or around a household or by children shall be labeled so that all items of information required by the Act appear upon the article itself. In instances where this is impracticable (for example, because of the size or nature of the article), the required cautionary labeling must be displayed by means of a tag or other suitable material that is no less than five square inches in area and is securely affixed to the article so that the labeling will remain attached throughout conditions of merchandising and distribution to the ultimate consumer. The placement and conspicuousness of all cautionary labeling appearing on such a tag or material, or on an unpackaged article, shall conform to the provisions of paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section. For the purposes of determining the proper type size to use on a tag or other material, the area of one side of the tag or other material shall be the area of the principal display panel.",
            "(g) Exemptions. All requirements of the Act are satisfied by compliance with this \u00a7 1500.121. However, exemptions can be granted under section 3(c) of the Act and \u00a7 1500.83, or under the provisions of another statute should this section be incorporated in regulations under another statute. Section 1500.82 contains the requirements for exemption requests under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act.",
            "(h) Effective date. The provisions of this rule apply to hazardous substances bearing labels printed after December 30, 1985. Labels printed prior to the effective date of this rule may be applied until not later than December 28, 1987. This rule applies to all hazardous substances to which labels are applied after December 28, 1987."

At one time, this direction was considered medically acceptable. However, the Commission has obtained information showing that the instruction to perform saline emesis is no longer appropriate. This is because the use of salt to induce vomiting can cause severe hypernatremia (salt poisoning) with potentially toxic effects, particularly in children 5 years old or younger, the age group most often involved in accidental poisonings. In view of the availability of safer and more effective emetics such as ipecac syrup, the Commission no longer recommends a direction to perform saline emesis as a first aid direction for inducing vomiting.",
            "(c) The Commission believes that, for products for which directions for saline emesis have been given in the past, ipecac syrup, U.S.P., is the most appropriate emetic, unless a particular contraindication exists in connection with any particular hazardous substance.",

            "A substance may be toxic due to a risk of a chronic hazard. (A regulatory definition of \u201ctoxic\u201d that pertains to chronic toxicity may be found at 16 CFR 1500.3(c)(2).) The following discussions are intended to help clarify the complex issues involved in assessing risk from substances that may potentially cause chronic hazards and, where possible, to describe conditions under which substances should be considered toxic due to a risk of the specified chronic hazards. The guidelines are not intended to be a static classification system, but should be considered along with available data and with expert judgment. They are not mandatory. Rather, the guidelines are intended as an aid to manufacturers in determining whether a product subject to the FHSA presents a chronic hazard. All default assumptions contained in the guidelines on hazard and risk determination are subject to replacement when alternatives which are supported by appropriate data become available. The following are brief summaries of more extensive discussions contained in the guidelines. Thus, the guidelines should be consulted in conjunction with these summaries. Copies of the guidelines may be obtained from the Office of Compliance and Enforcement, Consumer Product Safety Commission, Washington, DC 20207. (In addition to the chronic hazards discussed below, issues relating to the chronic hazard of sensitization are discussed in 16 CFR 1500.3(c)(5).)",
            "(a) Carcinogenicity. Substances are toxic by reason of their potential carcinogenicity in humans when they are known or probable human carcinogenic substances as defined below. Substances that are possible human carcinogenic substances or for which there is no evidence of carcinogenic effect under the following categories lack sufficient evidence to be considered toxic by virtue of their potential carcinogenicity.",
            "(1) Known Human carcinogenic Substances (\u201csufficient evidence\u201d in humans). Substances are toxic by reason of their carcinogenicity when they meet the \u201csufficient evidence\u201d criteria of carcinogenicity from studies in humans, which require that a causal relationship between exposure to an agent and cancer be established. This category is similar to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Group A, the International Agency for Research on Cancer's (IARC) Group 1, or the American National Standards Institute's (ANSI) Category 1. A causal relationship is established if one or more epidemiological investigations that meet the following criteria show an association between cancer and exposure to the agent.",
            "(i) No identified bias that can account for the observed association has been found on evaluation of the evidence.",
            "(ii) All possible confounding factors which could account for the observed association can be ruled out with reasonable confidence.",
            "(iii) Based on statistical analysis, the association has been shown unlikely to be due to chance.",
            "(2) Probable Human Carcinogenic Substances. Substances are also toxic by reason of their probable carcinogenicity when they meet the \u201climited evidence\u201d criteria of carcinogenicity in humans or the \u201csufficient evidence\u201d criteria of carcinogenicity in animals described below. This category is similar to EPA's Group B, IARC's Group 2, or ANSI's Categories 2 and 3. Evidence derived from animal studies that has been shown not to be relevant to humans is not included. For example, such evidence would result when there was an identified mechanism of action for a chemical that causes cancer in animals that has been shown not to apply to the human situation. It is reasonable, for practical purposes, to regard an agent for which there is \u201csufficient\u201d evidence of carcinogenicity in animals as if it presented a carcinogenic risk to humans.",
            "(i) \u201cLimited evidence\u201d of carcinogenicity in humans. The evidence is considered limited for establishing a causal relationship between exposure to the agent and cancer when a causal interpretation is credible, but chance, bias, or other confounding factors could not be ruled out with reasonable confidence.",
            "(ii) \u201cSufficient evidence\u201d of carcinogenicity in animals. Sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity requires that the substance has been tested in well-designed and -conducted studies (e.g., as conducted by National Toxicology Program (NTP), or consistent with the Office of Science Technology Assessment and Policy (OSTP) guidelines) and has been found to elicit a statistically significant (p <0.05) exposure-related increase in the incidence of malignant tumors, combined malignant and benign tumors, or benign tumors if there is an indication of the ability of such benign tumors to progress to malignancy:",
            "(A) In one or both sexes of multiple species, strains, or sites of independent origin; or experiments using different routes of administration or dose levels; or",
            "(B) To an unusual degree in a single experiment (one species/strain/sex) with regard to unusual tumor type, unusual tumor site, or early age at onset of the tumor.",
            "(3) Possible Human Carcinogenic Substance (\u201climited evidence\u201d animal carcinogen). In the absence of \u201csufficient\u201d or \u201climited\u201d human data, agents with \u201climited\u201d evidence of carcinogenicity from animal studies fall into this category. Such substances, and those that do not fall into any other group, are not considered \u201ctoxic.\u201d This does not imply that the substances are or are not carcinogens, only that the evidence is too uncertain to provide for a determination. This category is similar to EPA's Group C, IARC's Group 3, or ANSI's category 4.",
            "(b) Neurotoxicity. Substances are toxic by reason of their potential neurotoxicity in humans when they meet the \u201csufficient evidence\u201d or \u201climited evidence\u201d criteria of neurotoxicity in humans, or when they meet the \u201csufficient evidence\u201d criteria of neurotoxicity in animals.",
            "(1) Known Neurotoxic Substances (\u201csufficient evidence in humans\u201d). Substances are toxic by reason of their neurotoxicity and are considered \u201cknown neurotoxic substances\u201d when they meet the \u201csufficient evidence\u201d criteria of neurotoxicity derived from studies in humans which require that a causal association between exposure to an agent and neurotoxicity be established with a reasonable degree of certainty. Substances in this category meet the definition of \u201cneurotoxic\u201d as stated above. \u201cSufficient evidence,\u201d derived from human studies, for a causal association between exposure to a chemical and neurotoxicity is considered to exist if the studies meet the following criteria.",

            "(ii) The adverse effects/lesions account for the neurobehavioral dysfunction with reasonable certainty.",
            "(iii) All identifiable bias and confounding factors are reasonably discounted after consideration.",
            "(iv) The association has been shown unlikely to be due to chance, based on statistical analysis.",
            "(2) Probable Neurotoxic Substances. Substances are also toxic by reason of their probable neurotoxicity when they meet the \u201climited evidence\u201d criteria of neurotoxicity in humans, or the \u201csufficient evidence\u201d criteria derived from animal studies. Evidence derived from animal studies that has been shown not to be relevant to humans is not included. Such evidence would result, for example, when there was an identified mechanism of action for a chemical that causes neurotoxicity in animals that has been shown not to apply to the human situation.",
            "(i) \u201cLimited evidence\u201d of neurotoxicity in humans. The evidence derived from human studies is considered limited for neurotoxicity when the evidence is less than convincing, i.e., one of the criteria of \u201csufficient evidence\u201d of neurotoxicity for establishing a causal association between exposure to the agent and neurotoxicity is not met, leaving some uncertainties in establishing a causal association.",
            "(ii) \u201cSufficient evidence\u201d of neurotoxicity in animals. Sufficient evidence of neurotoxicity derived from animal studies for a causal association between exposure to a chemical and neurotoxicity requires that:",
            "(A) The substance has been tested in well-designed and -conducted studies (e.g., NTP's neurobehavioral battery, or conforming to EPA's neurotoxicity test guidelines); and",
            "(B) The substance has been found to elicit a statistically significant (p <0.05) increase in any neurotoxic effect in one or both sexes of multiple species, strains, or experiments using different routes of administration and dose-levels.",
            "(3) Possible Neurotoxic Substances. \u201cPossible neurotoxic substances\u201d are the substances which meet the \u201climited evidence\u201d criteria of neurotoxicity evidence derived from animal studies in the absence of human data, or in the presence of inadequate human data, or data which do not fall into any other group. Substances in this category are not considered \u201ctoxic.\u201d",
            "(c) Developmental and Reproductive Toxicity\u2014(1) Definitions of \u201cSufficient\u201d and \u201cLimited\u201d Evidence. The following definitions apply to all categories stated below.",
            "(i) \u201cSufficient evidence\u201d from human studies for a causal association between human exposure and the subsequent occurrence of developmental or reproductive toxicity is considered to exist if the studies meet the following criteria:",
            "(A) No identified bias that can account for the observed association has been found on evaluation of the evidence.",
            "(B) All possible confounding factors which could account for the observed association can be ruled out with reasonable confidence.",
            "(C) Based on statistical analysis, the association has been shown unlikely to be due to chance.",
            "(ii) \u201cLimited evidence\u201d from human studies exists when the human epidemiology meets all but one of the criteria for \u201csufficient evidence\u201d; i.e., the statistical evidence is borderline as opposed to clear-cut, there is a source of bias, or there are confounding factors that have not been and cannot be accounted for.",
            "(iii) \u201cSufficient evidence\u201d from animal studies exists when",
            "(A) Obtained from a good quality animal study; and",
            "(B) The substance has been found to elicit a statistically significant (p<0.05) treatment-related increase in multiple endpoints in a single species/strain, or in the incidence of a single endpoint at multiple dose levels or with multiple routes of administration in a single species/strain, or increase in the incidence of a single endpoint in multiple species/strains/ experiments.",
            "(iv) \u201cLimited evidence\u201d from animal studies exists when:",
            "(A) Obtained from a good quality study and there is a statistically significant (p<0.05) treatment-related increase in the incidence of a single endpoint in a single species/strain/experiment at a single dose level administered through only one route and such evidence otherwise does not meet the criteria for \u201csufficient evidence\u201d; or",
            "(B) The evidence is derived from studies which can be interpreted to show positive effects but have some qualitative or quantitative limitations with respect to experimental procedures (e.g., doses, exposure, follow-up, number of animals/group, reporting of the data, etc.) which would prevent classification of the evidence in the group of \u201csufficient evidence.\u201d",
            "(2) Developmental Toxicants. Substances are toxic by reason of their potential developmental or reproductive toxicity when they meet the \u201csufficient evidence\u201d or \u201climited evidence\u201d criteria of developmental or reproductive toxicity in humans, or when they meet the \u201csufficient evidence\u201d criteria of developmental or reproductive toxicity in animals. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Economic Community (EEC) have developed categories for teratogens but not other developmental toxicants. The teratogen guidelines limit the information only to structural birth defects and do not include other hazards of developmental toxicity such as embryonal death, fetal death, or functional deficiencies which are also important in assessing the overall toxicity of a substance when administered during pregnancy. Recently, EPA has proposed a system for classifying developmental toxicity. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has not yet developed any classification for developmental toxicity. The commission has established the following categories for determination of developmental toxicity according to the available evidence.",
            "(i) Known Human Developmental Toxicant (\u201csufficient evidence in humans\u201d). A substance is considered a \u201cknown human developmental toxicant\u201d if there is \u201csufficient\u201d human evidence to establish a causal association between human exposure and the subsequent occurrence of developmental toxicity manifested by death of the conceptus (embryo or fetus), or structural or functional birth defects. This category (Human Developmental Toxicant) is comparable to category 1 of the EEC and categories D and X of FDA, except that these guidelines are limited to teratogens. This category is also comparable to the category \u201cdefinitive evidence for human developmental toxicity\u201d proposed by EPA.",
            "(ii) Probable Human Developmental Toxicant. A substance is considered a \u201cprobable human developmental toxicant\u201d if there is \u201climited\u201d human evidence or \u201csufficient\u201d animal evidence to establish a causal association between human exposure and subsequent occurrence of developmental toxicity. This group (Probable Human Developmental Toxicant) is comparable to the category \u201cadequate evidence for human developmental toxicity\u201d proposed by EPA. This category is also comparable to category 2 of the EEC and category A1 of FDA, except that these guidelines are limited to teratogens.",
            "(iii) Possible Human Developmental Toxicant. A substance is considered a \u201cpossible human developmental toxicant\u201d if there is \u201climited\u201d animal evidence, in the absence of human data, or in the presence of inadequate human data, or which does not fall into any other group, to establish a causal association between human exposure and subsequent occurrence of developmental toxicity. EEC, FDA, and EPA have not developed a category comparable to this group. The Commission believes that data from well planned animal studies are important to consider even though they may provide only limited evidence of developmental toxicity.",
            "(3) Male Reproductive Toxicants. Male reproductive toxicants can be grouped into the following different categories based on evidence obtained from human or animal studies.",
            "(i) Known Human Male Reproductive Toxicant. A substance is considered a \u201cknown human male reproductive toxicant\u201d if there is \u201csufficient\u201d human evidence to establish a causal association between human exposure and the adverse effects on male reproductive main endpoints which are mating ability, fertility, and prenatal and postnatal development of the conceptus. This category is comparable to the one termed \u201cKnown Positive\u201d in the EPA guidelines on male reproductive risk assessment.",
            "(ii) Probable Human Male Reproductive Toxicant. A substance is considered a \u201cprobable human male reproductive toxicant\u201d if there is \u201climited\u201d human evidence or \u201csufficient\u201d animal evidence to establish a causal association between human exposure and the adverse effects on male reproductive main endpoints. This category is comparable to the one termed \u201cProbable Positive\u201d in the EPA guidelines on male reproductive risk assessment. However, the EPA category is based only on sufficient animal evidence. CPSC believes that limited human evidence is also sufficient for a chemical to be placed in this category.",
            "(iii) Possible Human Male Reproductive Toxicant. A substance is considered a \u201cpossible human male reproductive toxicant\u201d if there is limited animal evidence, in the absence of human data, or in the presence of inadequate human data, or which does not fall into any other group, to establish a causal association between human exposure and adverse effects on male reproductive main endpoints. This category is comparable to the one termed \u201cPossible Positive A\u201d in the EPA guidelines on male reproductive risk assessment. EPA proposes to use either limited human or limited animal evidence data to classify a toxicant as a \u201cPossible Positive A\u201d toxicant. As described above, CPSC would elevate limited human evidence to the category \u201cProbable Human Male Reproductive Toxicant.\u201d",
            "(4) Female Reproductive Toxicants. Female reproductive toxicants can be grouped into the following different categories based on evidence obtained from human or animal studies. EPA has proposed guidelines for assessing female reproductive risk but has not yet proposed a specific system for categorization of female reproductive toxicants.",
            "(i) Known Human Female Reproductive Toxicant. A substance is considered a \u201cknown human female reproductive toxicant\u201d if there is \u201csufficient\u201d human evidence to establish a causal association between human exposure and adverse effects on female reproductive function such as mating ability, fertility, and prenatal and postnatal development of the conceptus.",
            "(ii) Probable Human Female Reproductive Toxicant. A substance is considered a \u201cprobable human female reproductive toxicant\u201d if there is \u201climited\u201d human evidence or \u201csufficient\u201d animal evidence to establish a causal association between human exposure and adverse effects on female reproductive function.",
            "(iii) Possible Human Female Reproductive Toxicant. A substance is considered a \u201cpossible human female reproductive toxicant\u201d if there is \u201climited\u201d animal evidence, in the absence of human data, or in the presence of inadequate human data, or which does not fall into any other group, to establish a causal association between human exposure and adverse effects on female reproductive function.",
            "(d) Other Subjects Related to the Determination that a Substance is Toxic. Under the FHSA, for a toxic substance to be considered hazardous, it must not only have the potential to be hazardous but there must also be the potential that persons are exposed to the substance, that the substance can enter the body, and that there is a significant risk of an adverse health effect associated with the customary handling and use of the substance. Under these guidelines, existence of an adverse health effect means that such exposure is above the \u201cacceptable daily intake\u201d (\u201cADI\u201d). The ADI is based on the risks posed by the substance, and whether they are acceptable under the FHSA. This section addresses those issues by providing guidelines concerning assessment of exposure, assessment of bioavailability, determination of acceptable risks and the ADI to children and adults, and assessment of risk.",
            "(1) Assessment of Exposure. An exposure assessment may comprise a single exposure scenario or a distribution of exposures. Reasonably foreseeable use, as well as accidental exposure, should be taken into consideration when designing exposure studies. The following guidelines should be used in the assessment of exposure.",
            "(i) Inhalation. Inhalation studies to assess exposure should be reliable studies using direct monitoring of populations, predictions of exposure through modeling, or surrogate data.",
            "(A) Direct Monitoring. Populations to be monitored should be selected randomly to be representative of the general population, unless the exposure of a particular subset population is the desired goal of the assessment. The monitoring technique should be appropriate for the health effect of interest.",
            "(B) Modeling. Predictions of exposure to a chemical using mathematical models can be based on physical and chemical principles, such as mass balance principles. Mass balance models should consider the source strength of the product of interest, housing characteristics, and ambient conditions likely to be encountered by the studied population.",
            "(C) Surrogate Data. Surrogate data should only be used when data concerning the chemical of interest are sparse or unavailable and when there is a reasonable assurance that the surrogate data will accurately represent the chemical of interest.",
            "(ii) Oral Ingestion. Oral ingestion studies may involve direct monitoring of sources of chemicals as well as laboratory simulations. The estimation of exposure from ingestion of chemicals present in consumer products is predicted based upon estimates of use of the product and absorption of the chemical from the gastrointestinal tract. The following criteria should be established for laboratory simulations to estimate exposure:",
            "(A) A simulant or range of simulants should be carefully selected to mimic the possible range of conditions which occur in humans, such as full and empty stomachs, or various saliva compositions at different times of the day.",
            "(B) The mechanical action to which a product is submitted must be chosen to represent some range of realistic conditions to which a human may subject the product.",
            "(iii) Dermal Exposure. (A) Dermal exposure involves estimating the amount of substance contacting the skin. This may involve experiments measuring the amount of material leached from a product contacting a liquid layer which interfaces with the skin, or the amount of substance which migrates from a product (in solid or liquid form) which is in contact with the skin.",
            "(B) Parameters to be considered include: Surface area of the skin contacted, duration of contact, frequency of contact, and thickness of a liquid interfacial layer.",
            "(2) Assessment of Bioavailability. (i) The need to consider bioavailability in estimating the risk from use of a product containing a toxic substance only arises when it is anticipated that the absorption characteristics of a substance to which there is human exposure will differ from those characteristics for the substance tested in the studies used to define the dose-response relationship.",
            "(ii) In determining the need to assess bioavailability, the factors to be examined include:",
            "(A) The physical or chemical form of the substance,",
            "(B) The route of exposure (inhalation, ingestion, or through the skin),",
            "(C) The presence of other constituents in the product which interfere with or alter absorption of the toxic substance, and",

            "(3) Assessment of Risk. This section on quantitative risk assessment applies to estimates of risk for substances that are toxic by reason of their carcinogenicity.",
            "(i) Generally, the study leading to the highest risk should be used in the risk assessment; however, other factors may influence the choice of study.",
            "(ii) Risk should be based on the maximum likelihood estimate from a multistage model (such as Global83 or later version) unless the maximum likelihood estimate is not linear at low dose, in which case the 95% upper confidence limit on risk should be used.",
            "(iii) For systemic carcinogens, if estimates of human risk are made based on animal data, a factor derived from dividing the assumed human weight (70 kg) by the average animal weight during the study and taking that to the \n1/3 power should be used. There is the possibility that this factor may be changed, using the \n1/4 power instead of the \n1/3 power, as part of a unified Federal regulatory approach. If such an approach is adopted, it will apply here.",
            "(iv) When dose is expressed as parts per million, and the carcinogen acts at the site of contact, humans and animals exposed to the same amount for the same proportion of lifetime should be assumed to be equally sensitive.",
            "(v) If no experimental study having the same route of exposure as that anticipated for human use of a substance is available, a study by another route of exposure may be used. Pharmacokinetic methods may be used if sufficient data are available.",
            "(vi) When exposure scenarios are different from those used in the underlying study upon which estimates of risk are based, proportionality should be applied. If pharmacokinetic methods are used to adjust for risks at high versus low exposure levels, level-time measures should not be combined without taking the non-linearity into account.",
            "(4) Acceptable Risks\u2014(i) ADI for Carcinogens. The maximum acceptable daily intake (\u201cADI\u201d) is that exposure of a toxic (by virtue of its carcinogenicity) substance that is estimated to lead to a lifetime excess risk of one in a million. Exposure refers to the anticipated exposure from normal lifetime use of the product, including use as a child as well as use as an adult.",
            "(ii) ADI for Neurotoxicological and Developmental/Reproductive Agents. Due to the difficulties in using a numerical risk assessment method to determine risk for neurotoxicological or developmental/reproductive toxicants, the Commission is using a safety factor approach, as explained below.",
            "(A) Human Data. If the hazard is ascertained from human data, a safety factor of ten will be applied to the lowest No Observed Effect Level (\u201cNOEL\u201d) seen among the relevant studies. If no NOEL can be determined, a safety factor of 100 will be applied to the Lowest Observed Effect Level (\u201cLOEL\u201d). Both the NOEL and LOEL are defined in terms of daily dose level.",
            "(B) Animal Data. If the hazard is ascertained from animal data, a safety factor of one hundred will be applied to the lowest NOEL. If no NOEL can be determined, a safety factor of one thousand will be applied to the lowest LOEL. Both the NOEL and LOEL are defined in terms of daily dose level."

            "(a) Summary. (1) The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission issues this guidance to manufacturers, importers, distributors, and retailers to protect children from hazardous exposure to lead in consumer products. \n1\n The Commission identifies the major factors that it considers when evaluating products that contain lead, and informs the public of its experience with products that have exposed children to potentially hazardous amounts of lead.",
            "(2) To reduce the risk of hazardous exposure to lead, the Commission requests manufacturers to eliminate the use of lead that may be accessible to children from products used in or around households, schools, or in recreation. The Commission also recommends that, before purchasing products for resale, importers, distributors, and retailers obtain assurances from manufacturers that those products do not contain lead that may be accessible to children.",
            "(b) Hazard. Young children are most commonly exposed to lead in consumer products from the direct mouthing of objects, or from handling such objects and subsequent hand-to-mouth activity. The specific type and frequency of behavior that a child exposed to a product will exhibit depends on the age of the child and the characteristics and pattern of use of the product. The adverse health effects of lead poisoning in children are well-documented and may have long-lasting or permanent consequences. These effects include neurological damage, delayed mental and physical development, attention and learning deficiencies, and hearing problems. Because lead accumulates in the body, even exposures to small amounts of lead can contribute to the overall level of lead in the blood and to the subsequent risk of adverse health effects. Therefore, any unnecessary exposure of children to lead should be avoided. The scientific community generally recognizes a level of 10 micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood as a threshold level of concern with respect to lead poisoning. To avoid exceeding that level, young children should not chronically ingest more than 15 micrograms of lead per day from consumer products.",
            "(c) Guidance. (1) Under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (FHSA), 15 U.S.C. 1261(f)(1), household products that expose children to hazardous quantities of lead under reasonably foreseeable conditions of handling or use are \u201chazardous substances.\u201d A household product that is not intended for children but which creates such a risk of injury because it contains lead requires precautionary labeling under the Act. 15 U.S.C. 1261(p). A toy or other article intended for use by children which contains a hazardous amount of lead that is accessible for children to ingest is a banned hazardous substance. 15 U.S.C. 1261(q)(1)(B). In evaluating the potential hazard associated with products that contain lead, the Commission staff considers these major factors on a case-by-case basis: the total amount of lead contained in a product, the bioavailability of the lead, the accessibility of the lead to children, the age and foreseeable behavior of the children exposed to the product, the foreseeable duration of the exposure, and the marketing, patterns of use, and life cycle of the product.",
            "(2) Paint and similar surface coatings containing lead have historically been the most commonly-recognized sources of lead poisoning among the products within the Commission's jurisdiction. The Commission has, by regulation, banned paint and other similar surface coatings that contain more than 0.06% lead (\u201clead-containing paint\u201d), toys and other articles intended for use by children that bear lead-containing paint, and furniture articles for consumer use that bear lead-containing paint. 16 CFR Part 1303. In recent years, however, the Commission staff has identified a number of disparate products\u2014some intended for use by children and others simply used in or around the household or in recreation\u2014that presented a risk of lead poisoning from sources other than paint. These products included vinyl miniblinds, crayons, figurines used as game pieces, and children's jewelry.",
            "(3) In several of these cases, the staff's determination that the products presented a risk of lead poisoning resulted in recalls or in the replacement of those products with substitutes, in addition to an agreement to discontinue the use of lead in future production. The Commission believes that, had the manufacturers of these lead-containing products acted with prudence and foresight before introducing the products into commerce, they would not have used lead at all. This in turn would have eliminated both the risk to young children and the costs and other consequences associated with the corrective actions.",
            "(4) The Commission urges manufacturers to eliminate lead in consumer products to avoid similar occurrences in the future. However, to avoid the possibility of a Commission enforcement action, a manufacturer who believes it necessary to use lead in a consumer product should perform the requisite analysis before distribution to determine whether the exposure to lead causes the product to be a \u201chazardous substance.\u201d If the product is a hazardous substance and is also a children's product, it is banned. If it is a hazardous household substance but is not intended for use by children, it requires precautionary labeling. This same type of analysis also should be performed on materials substituted for lead.",
            "(5) The Commission also notes that, under the FHSA, any firm that purchases a product for resale is responsible for determining whether that product contains lead and, if so, whether it is a \u201chazardous substance.\u201d The Commission, therefore, recommends that, prior to the acquisition or distribution of such products, importers, distributors, and retailers obtain information and data, such as analyses of chemical composition or accessibility, relevant to this determination from manufacturers, or have such evaluations conducted themselves."

            "(a) Summary. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission issues this guidance to manufacturers, importers, distributors, and retailers to protect children from exposure to hazardous chemicals found in liquid-filled children's products, such as rolling balls, bubble watches, necklaces, pens, paperweights, keychains, liquid timers, and mazes. \n1\n The Commission identifies the major factors that it considers when evaluating liquid-filled children's products that contain hazardous chemicals, and informs the public of its experience with exposure to these hazardous chemicals to children. To reduce the risk of exposure to hazardous chemicals, such as mercury, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, methanol, methylene chloride, petroleum distillates, toluene, xylene, and related chemicals, the Commission requests manufacturers to eliminate the use of such chemicals in children's products. The Commission also recommends that, before purchasing products for resale, importers, distributors, and retailers obtain assurances from manufacturers that liquid-filled children's products do not contain hazardous liquid chemicals.",
            "(b) Hazard. During reasonably foreseeable handling or use of liquid-filled children's products, hazardous chemicals may become accessible to young children in a manner that places children at risk. Young children are exposed to the chemicals from directly mouthing them or from handling such objects and subsequent hand-to-mouth or hand-to-eye activity. The specific type and frequency of behavior that a child exposed to a product will exhibit depends on the age of the child and the characteristics and pattern of use of the product. The adverse health effects of these chemicals to children include chemical poisoning from ingestion of the chemicals, pneumonia from aspiration of the chemicals into the lungs, and skin and eye irritation from exposure to the chemicals. The chemicals may also be combustible.",
            "(c) Guidance. (1) Under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (FHSA), products that are toxic or irritants and that may cause substantial injury or illness under reasonably foreseeable conditions of handling or use, including reasonably foreseeable ingestion by children, are \u201chazardous substances.\u201d 15 U.S.C. 1261(f)(1). A product that is not intended for children, but that creates a risk of substantial injury or illness because it contains hazardous chemicals, requires precautionary labeling under the Act. 15 U.S.C. 1261(p). A toy or other article intended for use by children that contains an accessible and harmful amount of a hazardous chemical is banned. 15 U.S.C. 1261(q)(1)(A). In evaluating the potential hazard associated with children's products that contain hazardous chemicals, the Commission's staff considers certain factors on a case-by-case basis, including: the total amount of the hazardous chemical in a product, the accessibility of the hazardous chemicals to children, the risk presented by that accessibility, the age and foreseeable behavior of the children exposed to the product, and the marketing, patterns of use, and life cycle of the product.",
            "(2) The Commission's staff has identified a number of liquid-filled children's products, such as rolling balls, bubble watches, necklaces, pens, paperweights, maze toys, liquid timers, and keychains, that contain hazardous chemicals. In several of these cases, the staff determined that these products violated the FHSA because they presented a risk of chemical poisoning and/or chemical pneumonia from aspiration. This determination resulted in recalls or in the replacement of those products with substitutes, as well as in agreements with the manufacturers to discontinue the use of hazardous chemicals in liquid-filled children's products in future production. The Commission believes that these hazardous substances pose a risk to young children and, consequently, manufacturers should not have included them in the product design or manufacturing process.",
            "(3) Therefore, the Commission considers the use of hazardous chemicals in children's products such as those described above to be ill-advised and encourages manufacturers to avoid using them in such products. Further, the Commission recommends that, before purchasing such products for resale, importers, distributors, and retailers obtain assurances from the manufacturers that liquid-filled children's products do not contain hazardous liquid chemicals."

          "heading": "\u00a7 1500.232   Statement on animal testing policy.",
          "paragraphs": [
            "(a) Summary. (1) The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission issues this statement of policy on animal testing and alternatives to animal testing of hazardous substances regulated under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (FHSA). The FHSA requires appropriate cautionary labeling on certain hazardous household products to alert consumers to the potential hazard(s) that the products may present. Among the hazards addressed by the FHSA are toxicity, corrosivity, sensitization, and irritation.",
            "(2) In order to determine the appropriate cautionary labeling, it is necessary to have objective criteria by which the existence of each hazard can be determined. Hazards such as toxicity, tissue corrosiveness, eye irritancy, and skin irritancy result from the biological response of living tissue and organs to the presence of the hazardous substance. One means of characterizing these hazards is to use animal testing as a proxy for the human reaction. In fact, the FHSA defines the hazard category of \u201chighly toxic\u201d in terms of animal toxicity when groups of 10 or more rats are exposed to specified amounts of the substance. The Commission's regulations under the FHSA concerning toxicity and irritancy allow the use of animal tests to determine the presence of the hazard when human data or existing animal data are not available.",
            "(3) Neither the FHSA nor the Commission's regulations requires animal testing. The FHSA and its implementing regulations only require that a product be labeled to reflect the hazards associated with that product. If animal testing is conducted, Commission policy supports limiting such tests to a minimum number of animals and advocates measures that eliminate or reduce the pain or discomfort to animals that can be associated with such tests. The Commission has prepared this statement of policy with respect to animal testing to encourage the manufacturers subject to the FHSA to follow a similar policy.",
            "(4) In making the appropriate hazard determinations, manufacturers of products subject to the FHSA should use existing alternatives to animal testing whenever possible. These include: prior human experience (e.g., published case studies), in vitro or in silico test methods that have been approved by the Commission, literature sources containing the results of prior animal testing or limited human tests (e.g., clinical trials, dermal patch testing), and expert opinion (e.g., hazard assessment, structure-activity analysis). If a manufacturer or other entity performs a hazard test for FHSA labeling purposes that has not been previously approved by the Commission, CPSC staff will consider the data on a case-by-case basis and, upon review, determine whether to post the test method on the animal testing Web site. The Commission recommends resorting to animal testing only when the other information sources have been exhausted. At this time, the Commission recommends use of the most humane procedures with the fewest animals possible to achieve reliable results. Recommended procedures are summarized in the following statement and can be accessed on the Commission's Web page at: http://www.cpsc.gov/library/animaltesting.html. If a manufacturer or other entity performs a hazard test for FHSA labeling purposes that has not been previously approved by the Commission (e.g., an ICCVAM-recommended test method or one of the tests described in the current version of the FHSA), CPSC staff will consider the data on a case-by-case basis and, upon review, determine whether to post the test method on the animal testing Web site.",
            "(b) Statement of policy on animal testing. (1) Neither the FHSA nor the Commission's regulations requires animal testing. Reliable human experience always takes precedence over results from animal data. In the cases where animal tests are conducted, the Commission prefers test methods that reduce stress and suffering in test animals and that use fewer animals while maintaining scientific integrity. To this end, the Commission reviews recommendations on alternative test methods developed by the scientific and regulatory communities. Current descriptions of test method recommendations approved by or known to the Commission can be accessed via the Internet at: http://www.cpsc.gov/library/animaltesting.html. The Commission strongly supports the use of scientifically sound alternatives to animal testing. The following parts of this section outline some of these alternatives. Testing laboratories and other interested persons requiring assistance interpreting the results obtained when a substance is tested in accordance with the methods described here, or in following the testing strategies outlined in the section, should refer to the Commission's animal testing Web page at: http://www.cpsc.gov/library/animaltesting.html.",
            "(i) Acute toxicity. The traditional FHSA animal test for acute toxicity determines the median lethal dose (LD50) or lethal concentration (LC50), the dose or concentration that is expected to kill half the test animals. Procedures for determining the median LD50/LC50 are described in section 2(h)(1) of the Act and supplemented in \u00a7 1500.3(c)(1) and (2) and the test method outlined in \u00a7 1500.40. The Commission recommends in vitro alternatives over in vivo LD50/LC50 tests, or using modifications of the traditional LD50/LC50 test during toxicity testing that reduce the number of animals tested whenever possible. Data from in vitro or in silico test methods that have not been approved by the Commission may be submitted to the Commission for consideration of their acceptability. Commission-approved testing alternatives are identified on the Web site at: http://www.cpsc.gov/library/animaltesting.html and include:",
            "(A) In vitro and in vivo test methods that have been scientifically validated and approved for use in toxicity testing by the Commission;",
            "(B) Valid in vitro methods to estimate a starting dose for an acute in vivo test;",
            "(C) A sequential version of the traditional LD50/LC50 tests described in \u00a7 1500.3(c)(1) and (2) and the test method described in \u00a7 1500.40, in which dose groups are run successively rather than simultaneously;",
            "(D) A limit-dose test where the LD50/LC50 is determined as a point estimate, which can still be used to categorize a hazard, although it gives no information on hazard dose-response. In the limit test, animals (10 rats) each receive a single dose of product at 5g per kilogram of body weight. If not more than one animal dies in 14 days, the product is considered to have an LD50 of greater than 5g/kg, and thus, deemed to be nontoxic. Only if two or more animals die is a second group of 10 rats tested (at a lower dose). This procedure reduces the number of animals tested from the 80 to 100 animals involved in a full LD50 test to, typically, 10 to 20 rats per product. This reduction in the number of animals tested is justified because an exact LD50 is not required by either the FHSA or the regulations. The FHSA requires only a categorical determination that the toxicity is greater than 5g/kg, between 50 mg/kg and 5g/kg, or less than 50 mg/kg.",
            "(ii) Dermal irritation/corrosivity. An acceptable in vitro test method or weight-of-evidence analysis is recommended before in vivo dermal irritation testing is considered to determine appropriate cautionary labeling. The weight-of-evidence analysis should incorporate any existing data on humans and animals, validated in vitro or in silico test results (valid tests are identified on the Commission's animal testing Web site at: http://www.cpsc.gov/library/animaltesting.html), the substance's dermal toxicity, evidence of corrosivity/irritation of one or more structurally related substances or mixtures of such substances, data demonstrating low or high pH (\u22642 or \u226511.5) of the substance, and any other relevant physicochemical properties that indicate the substance might be a dermal corrosive or irritant. If there is any indication from this analysis that the substance is either corrosive or irritating to the skin, the substance should be labeled appropriately. If the substance is not corrosive in vitro, but no data exist regarding its irritation potential, human patch testing should be considered. If in vitro data are unavailable, human patch testing is not an option, and there are insufficient data to determine the weight-of-evidence, a tiered in vivo animal test is recommended.",
            "(A) In a tiered in vivo dermal study, a single rabbit is tested initially. If the outcome is positive for corrosivity, testing is stopped, and the substance is labeled appropriately. If the substance is not corrosive, two more rabbits should be patch-tested to complete the assessment of skin irritation potential.",
            "(B) If a tiered test is not feasible, the Commission recommends the test method described in \u00a7 1500.41. Note that in any in vivo dermal irritation test method, the Commission recommends using a semiocclusive patch to cover the animal's test site and eliminating the use of stocks for restraint during the exposure period, thereby allowing the animal free mobility and access to food and water.",
            "(iii) Ocular irritation. A weight-of-evidence analysis is recommended to evaluate existing information before any in vivo ocular irritation testing is considered. This analysis should incorporate any existing data on humans and animals, validated in vitro or in silico test data (identified on the Commission's animal testing Web site at: http://www.cpsc.gov/library/animaltesting.html), the substance's dermal corrosivity/irritation (primary skin irritants and corrosives are also usually eye irritants and therefore do not need to be tested in the eye), evidence of ocular irritation of one or more structurally related substances or mixtures of such substances, data demonstrating high acidity or alkalinity of the substance, and any other relevant physicochemical properties that indicate the substance might be a dermal corrosive or irritant or ocular irritant.",
            "(A) When the weight-of-evidence is insufficient to determine a substance's ocular irritation, a Commission-approved in vitro or in silico assay for ocular irritancy should be run to assess eye irritation potential and determine labeling. Examples of Commission-validated in vitro assays are identified on the Commission's animal testing Web site at: http://www.cpsc.gov/library/animaltesting.html). If no valid in vitro test exists, the test strategy for determining dermal corrosion/irritation outlined in paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(B) of this section can be followed to determine ocular irritation.",
            "(B) If the dermal test strategy outlined in section paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(B) of this section leads to a conclusion of not corrosive, a tiered in vivo ocular irritation test should be performed, in which a single rabbit is exposed to the substance initially. If the outcome of this initial test is positive, testing is stopped, and the substance is labeled an eye irritant. If the outcome of this initial test is negative, one to two more rabbits are tested for ocular irritation, and the outcome of this test will determine the label. If a tiered test is not feasible, the Commission recommends the test method described in \u00a7 1500.42.",
            "(C) When any ocular irritancy testing on animals is conducted, including the method described in \u00a7 1500.42, the Commission recommends a threefold plan to reduce animal suffering: The use of preemptive pain management, including topical anesthetics and systemic analgesics that eliminate or reduce suffering that may occur as a result of the application process or from the test substance itself (an example of a typical preemptive pain treatment is two applications of tetracaine ophthalmic anesthetic, 10-15 minutes apart, prior to instilling the test material to the eye); post-treatment with systemic analgesics for pain relief; and implementation of humane endpoints, including scheduled observations, monitoring, and recording of clinical signs of distress and pain, and recording the nature, severity, and progression of eye injuries. The specific techniques that have been approved by the Commission can be found at: http://www.cpsc.gov/library/animaltesting.html.",
            "(iv) Dermal sensitization. An acceptable in vitro test method (examples of valid in vitro tests are identified on the Commission's animal testing Web site at: http://www.cpsc.gov/library/animaltesting.html), or weight-of-evidence analysis is recommended before in vivo animal sensitization testing is considered to determine appropriate cautionary labeling. The weight-of-evidence analysis should incorporate any existing data on humans and animals, validated in vitro or in silico test results, and any relevant physicochemical properties that indicate the substance might be a dermal sensitizer. If there is any indication from this analysis that the substance is sensitizing to the skin, the substance should be labeled appropriately.",

            "(a) Scope, basis, and purpose. This part 1513 prescribes requirements for bunk beds to reduce or eliminate the risk that children will die or be injured from being trapped between the upper bunk and the wall or in openings below guardrails or in other structures in the bed. Bunk beds meeting these requirements are exempted from 16 CFR 1500.18(a)(18).",
            "(b) Application and effective date. This part applies to all bunk beds, except those manufactured only for institutional use, that are manufactured in the United States, or imported, on or after June 19, 2000. (Facilities intended for use by children under age 6 are not considered to be institutions.) Bunk beds, as described in this section, that are not intended for use by children are subject to the requirements in 16 CFR part 1213, and not to 16 CFR 1500.18(a)(18). However, the provisions of 16 CFR 1213 are substantively identical to the requirements in this part 1513."

            "(2) One guardrail shall be continuous between each of the bed's end structures. \u201cContinuous\u201d means that any gap between the guardrail and end structure shall not exceed 0.22 inches (5.6 mm) (so as to not cause a finger entrapment hazard for a child).",

            "(6) The upper edge of the guardrails shall be no less than 5 inches (130 mm) above the top surface of the mattress when a mattress of the maximum thickness specified by the manufacturer's instructions is on the bed. This requirement does not prohibit a wall-side guardrail that terminates in a quarter-circle bend and attaches to the side rail of the upper bunk foundation.",
            "(7) With no mattress on the bed, there shall be no openings in the structure between the lower edge of the uppermost member of the guardrail and the underside of the upper bunk's foundation that would permit passage of the wedge block shown in Figure 1 of this part when tested in accordance with the procedure at \u00a7 1513.4(a).",

By visual inspection, determine if there is simultaneous contact between the boundary of the opening and both sides of the \u201cA\u201d section of the template. If simultaneous contact occurs, mark the contact points on the boundary of the opening and conduct the additional test described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section.",
            "(ii) To check the potential for neck entrapment, place the neck portion of the \u201cB\u201d section of the template into the opening, with its plane perpendicular to both the plane of the opening and the centerline of the opening (see Figure 4 of this part). If the neck portion of the \u201cB\u201d section of the template can completely enter the opening (passes 0.75 inch or more beyond the points previously contacted by the \u201cA\u201d section of the template), the opening is considered to present a neck entrapment hazard and fails the test, unless its lower boundary slopes downward at 45\u201d or more for the whole distance from the narrowest part of the opening the neck can reach to the part of the opening that will freely pass a 9-inch diameter sphere."

In both the adult tests, reclosable packages, if assembled by the testing agency, shall be properly secured at least 72 hours prior to beginning the test to allow the materials (e.g., the closure liner) to \u201ctake a set.\u201d If assembled by the testing agency, torque-dependent closures shall be secured at the same on-torque as applied on the packaging line. Application torques must be recorded in the test report. All packages shall be handled so that no damage or jarring will occur during storage or transportation. The packages shall not be exposed to extreme conditions of heat or cold. The packages shall be tested at room temperature.",
            "(2) Child test\u2014(i) Test subjects\u2014(A) Selection criteria. Use from 1 to 4 groups of 50 children, as required under the sequential testing criteria in table 1. No more than 20% of the children in each group shall be tested at or obtained from any given site. Each group of children shall be randomly selected as to age, subject to the limitations set forth below. Thirty percent of the children in each group shall be of age 42-44 months, 40% of the children in each group shall be of age 45-48 months, and 30% of the children in each group shall be of age 49-51 months. The children's ages in months shall be calculated as follows:",
            "(1) Arrange the birth date and test date by the numerical designations for month, day, and year (e.g., test date: 8/3/1990; birth date: 6/23/1986).",
            "(2) Subtract the month, day, and year numbers for the birth date from the respective numbers for the test date. This may result in negative numbers for the months or days. (e.g.,",
            "(3) Multiply the difference in years by 12 to obtain the number of months in the difference in years, and add this value to the number of months that was obtained when the birth date was subtracted from the test date (i.e., 4 \u00d7 12 = 48; 48 + 2 = 50). This figure either will remain the same or be adjusted up or down by 1 month, depending on the number of days obtained in the subtraction of the birth date from the test date.",
            "(4) If the number of days obtained by subtracting the days in the birth date from the days in the test date is + 16 or more, 1 month is added to the number of months obtained above. If the number of days is \u221216 or less, subtract 1 month. If the number of days is between \u221215 and + 15 inclusive, no change is made in the number of months. Thus, for the example given above, the number of days is \u221220, and the number of months is therefore 50 \u2212 1 = 49 months.",
            "(B) Gender distribution. The difference between the number of boys and the number of girls in each age range shall not exceed 10% of the number of children in that range. The children selected should have no obvious or overt physical or mental handicap. A parent or guardian of each child shall read and sign a consent form prior to the child's participation. (The Commission staff will not disregard the results of tests performed by other parties simply because informed consent for children is not obtained.)",
            "(ii) Test failures. A test failure shall be any child who opens the special packaging or gains access to its contents. In the case of unit packaging, however, a test failure shall be any child who opens or gains access to the number of individual units which constitute the amount that may produce serious personal injury or serious illness, or a child who opens or gains access to more than 8 individual units, whichever number is lower, during the full 10 minutes of testing. The number of units that a child opens or gains access to is interpreted as the individual units from which the product has been or can be removed in whole or in part. The determination of the amount of a substance that may produce serious personal injury or serious illness shall be based on a 25-pound (11.4 kg) child. Manufacturers or packagers intending to use unit packaging for a substance requiring special packaging are requested to submit such toxicological data to the Commission's Office of Compliance.",
            "(iii) Sequential test. The sequential test is initially conducted using 50 children, and, depending on the results, the criteria in table 1 determine whether the package is either child-resistant or not child-resistant or whether further testing is required. Further testing is required if the results are inconclusive and involves the use of one or more additional groups of 50 children each, up to a maximum of 200 children. No individual shall administer the test to more than 30% of the children tested in each group. Table 1 gives the acceptance (pass), continue testing, and rejection (fail) criteria to be used for the first 5 minutes and the full 10 minutes of the children's test. If the test continues past the initial 50-child panel, the package openings shown in table 1 are cumulative.",
            "(iv) Test procedures. The children shall be divided into groups of two. The testing shall be done in a location that is familiar to the children, for example, their customary nursery school or regular kindergarten. No child shall test more than two special packages. When more than one special package is being tested, each package shall be of a different ASTM type and they shall be presented to the paired children in random order. This order shall be recorded. The children shall be tested by the procedure incorporated in the following test instructions:",
            "(3) Senior-adult panel\u2014(i) Test subjects. Use a group of 100 senior adults. Not more than 24% of the senior adults tested shall be obtained from or tested at any one site. Each group of senior adults shall be randomly selected as to age, subject to the limitations set forth below. Twenty-five percent of the participants shall be 50-54 years of age, 25% of participants shall be 55-59 years of age, and 50% of the participants shall be 60-70 years old. Seventy percent of the participants of ages 50-59 and ages 60-70 shall be female (17 or 18 females shall be apportioned to the 50-54 year age group). No individual tester shall administer the test to more than 35% of the senior adults tested. The adults selected should have no obvious or overt physical or mental disability.",
            "(ii) Screening procedures. Participants who are unable to open the packaging being tested in the first 5-minute time period, are given a screening test. The screening tests for this purpose shall use two packages with conventional (not child-resistant (CR) or \u201cspecial\u201d) closures. One closure shall be a plastic snap closure and the other a CT plastic closure. Each closure shall have a diameter of 28 mm\u00b118%, and the CT closures shall have been resecured 72 hours before testing at 10 inch-pounds of torque. The containers for both the snap- and CT-type closures shall be round plastic containers, in sizes of 2 ounce\u00b1\n1/2 ounce for the CT-type closure and 8 drams\u00b14 drams for the snap-type closure. Persons who cannot open and close both of the screening packages in 1-minute screening tests shall not be counted as participants in the senior-adult panel.",
            "(iii) SAUE. The senior adult use effectiveness (SAUE) is the percentage of adults who both opened the package in the first (5-minute) test period and opened and (if appropriate) properly resecured the package in the 1-minute test period.",
            "(iv) Test procedures. The senior adults shall be tested individually, rather than in groups of two or more. The senior adults shall receive only such printed instructions on how to open and properly secure the special packaging as will appear on or accompany the package as it is delivered to the consumer. The senior-adult panel is tested according to the procedure incorporated in the following senior-adult panel test instructions:",
            "(4) Younger-adult panel. (i) One hundred adults, age 18 to 45 inclusive, with no overt physical or mental handicaps, and 70% of whom are female, shall comprise the test panel for younger adults. Not more than 35% of adults shall be obtained or tested at any one site. No individual tester shall administer the test to more than 35% of the adults tested. The adults shall be tested individually, rather than in groups of two or more. The adults shall receive only such printed instructions on how to open and properly resecure the special packaging as will appear on the package as it is delivered to the consumer. Five minutes shall be allowed to complete the opening and, if appropriate, the resecuring process.",
            "(ii) Records shall be kept of the number of adults unable to open and of the number of the other adults tested who fail to properly resecure the special packaging.

            "(a) In order to assist manufacturers of prescription drugs in discharging their responsibilities under the act concerning such drugs that are distributed to pharmacies, the Consumer Product Safety Commission has codified this statement of its policy concerning which prescription drug packages supplied by manufacturers to pharmacies must comply with the \u201cspecial\u201d (child-resistant) packaging requirements contained in 16 CFR 1700.15.",
            "(b) Manufacturers of prescription drugs may package such drugs for distribution to pharmacies in different types of packages, depending on whether the manufacturer intends that the package will be the one in which the drug is ultimately given to the consumer or whether it is intended that the pharmacist will repackage the drug before it is dispensed to the consumer. If the drug is supplied in a bulk package from which individual prescriptions are intended to be repackaged by the pharmacist, the manufacturer need not utilize special packaging. However, the Commission interprets the provision of the act as requiring that all prescription drugs subject to a special packaging standard that are distributed to pharmacies shall be in special packaging if the immediate package in which the drugs are distributed by the manufacturer is intended to be the package in which the drugs are dispensed to the consumer. Examples of such packages include mnemonic dispensing devices; dropper bottles; packages with \u201ctear off\u201d labels; packages which incorporate ancillary instructions for consumer handling, storage, or use on permanently affixed portions of their labels; and products intended to be reconstituted in their original containers. The Commission believes that this interpretation is necessary in order to insure that the pharmacist will actually dispense the drug in the proper package. If the pharmacist receives a request from the consumer or an order from the prescribing medical practitioner for conventional (noncomplying) packaging, section 4(b) of the act permits the pharmacist to convert the package to conventional packaging or repackage the drug in conventional packaging.",
            "(c) Manufacturers should also note that section 4(a) of the act (which allows a product to be marketed in noncomplying packaging of a single size under certain circumstances) does not apply to prescription drugs subject to section 4(b) of the act. Thus, since the section 4(a) single-size exemption for over-the-counter drugs and other household substances does not apply to prescription drugs, every unit of a prescription drug subject to a special packaging standard which is distributed to a pharmacy in a package intended by the manufacturer to be dispensed to a consumer shall be in special packaging.",
            "(d) Nothing in this statement of policy and interpretation should be interpreted as relieving the pharmacist of the responsibility of insuring that all prescription drugs subject to a special packaging standard are dispensed to the consumer in special packaging unless otherwise ordered by the prescribing practitioner or otherwise requested by the consumer."

          "paragraphs": [
            "Experimental data are generated in both animals and humans in controlled situations in order to evaluate the biological effects of a substance. Certain toxicological effects cannot generally be evaluated in human beings. This is especially true of those substances which are not normally intended to be used in or on the human body or animal body. Therefore, the Commission considers experimental data obtained in animal studies to be an important supplement to such data as may exist from any experimental studies conducted in humans. The minimum toxicological evaluation necessary for a particular household substance is proportional to the expected exposure of man to that substance. Household substances which are not expected, in normal use, to contact man are subject to less extensive studies than those substances, such as drugs, which are designed to be used in or on man. The Commission has, therefore, separated the requirements of this section into three subsections. Section 1702.9(a) lists minimum acute animal toxicity data which shall be submitted, if reasonably available, for all petitions; \u00a7 1702.9(b) lists those additional data which shall be submitted, if reasonably available, for drug products and all other household substances which are normally intended to be used in or on the human body; and \u00a7 1702.9(c) lists those additional data which shall be submitted, if reasonably available, by petitioners requesting exemption for substances not intended for use in or on the human or animal body. The Commission emphasizes that, while not absolutely necessary, the types of data outlined in \u00a7 1702.9(c) may greatly expedite the Commission's evaluation of a particular exemption request.",
            "(a) General criteria applicable to all petitions. (1) Each petition for an exemption under this part shall include all reasonably available relevant experimental data relating to the petition regardless of whether such data are unfavorable to the petitioner's request. As used in this part, the term \u201crelevant experimental data\u201d includes, but is not limited to, all data, including animal and human studies revealing the nature and degree of the hazard associated with the particular substance. Generally, the hazard associated with the particular substance involves the risk of injury arising from the acute accidental ingestion of a product. Where a hazard different from the risk of injury arising from accidental ingestion is known to exist (e.g., potential for significant allergenicity, dermal or opthalmic injury from handling or using the product), the petitioner shall also submit all reasonably available relevant experimental data evaluating the nature and degree of any additional hazard(s).",
            "(2) All animal studies submitted in support of exemption requests should be performed in conformity with good pharmacological and toxicological practice which includes, as a minimum, complete descriptions of protocols used in experimental animal studies, and signed laboratory reports which include the following basic information:",
            "(i) An exact description of materials tested;",
            "(ii) A description of test animals employed in studies, including number, age, weight, sex and nutritional state of animals;",
            "(iii) Dosage level(s) and number of animals tested per dosage level;",
            "(iv) Basis upon which dosage was administered (e.g., as salt or base);",
            "(v) Route of administration and dosage volume; and",
            "(vi) Appendices containing all raw data and any additional data generated subsequent to the completion of the original study (e.g., results of histopathological examinations, if performed).",
            "(3) Each petition shall include all reasonably available reports of Median Lethal Dosage (LD50) studies and shall include all raw data obtained in such studies. These studies should normally be conducted in both adult and weanling animals of the same species. The oral route of administration should be followed for studies involving substances subject to regulations promulgated under the Poison Prevention Packaging Act of 1970. Where a percutaneous toxicity hazard exists, the petition shall include reasonably available studies using the percutaneous route of administration. Sufficient dosage levels as well as adequate numbers of test animals per dosage level should be used to give statistical reliability to determined LD50 values.",
            "(4) In view of the fact that LD50 values in themselves do not necessarily reflect a true estimate of the overall toxic potential of a substance, LD50 determinations should, where an LD50 value may be calculated, include:",
            "(i) The LD50 value with 95 percent confidence limits;",
            "(ii) A slope determination for the dose response curve, including 95 percent confidence limits; and",
            "(iii) A description of the statistical method employed in the analysis of such data (with proper citation) as well as the statistical analysis itself.",
            "(5) The Commission shall disregard any data which do not fulfill the strict requirements of the statistical method used in their analyses. Modifications of accepted statistical methods which have been published in the literature are acceptable to the Commission provided that a copy of the published work is submitted.",
            "(6) Acute toxicity studies submitted with petitions should have at least a seven day observation period of test animals. Good pharmacological practice provides that test animals are observed closely for several hours following test substance administration and less frequently on subsequent test days. Succumbing animals should be necropsied as soon as practicable following death, while surviving animals should be necropsied, and gross pathological alterations noted, at the end of the observation period. Documentation of non-lethal effects occurring during these observation periods should be submitted in conjunction with acute toxicity laboratory reports. Documentation of any lethal effects occurring at high dosage levels, including mode of death (e.g., cardiac arrest/respiratory arrest), and time of death should be submitted in conjunction with acute toxicity laboratory reports. Reports of gross necropsies performed upon surviving animals should be submitted, as well as results of necropsies performed upon animals succumbing to the test substance, provided that such animals are examined prior to the onset of autolysis. Results of microscopic examinations, when indicated by the nature or results of an acute toxicity study, shall also be submitted.",
            "(b) Additional data criteria for petitions involving substances normally used in or on the human or animal body. (1) Petitioners submitting exemption requests for substances normally used on or taken into the human body or animal body shall, in addition to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section submit the following data, where reasonably available:",
            "(i) Summary laboratory reports of data obtained in subacute and chronic animal studies where the data pertain to the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of substances in question;",
            "(ii) A median lethal dosage (LD50) determination conducted in one additional species. Of the two LD50 determinations required for persons submitting exemption requests under this part, one should be conducted in a nonrodent species;",
            "(iii) Summary reports of data obtained in human studies designed to measure the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of substances in question; and",
            "(iv) Data indicating, insofar as is known, the mechanism of action of the substance in question and the mechanism by which expected toxicological effects occur. If these mechanisms are unknown, the petition should state this.",
            "(2) Petitioners submitting exemption requests for substances normally used on or taken into the human or animal body shall, in addition to the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b)(1) of this section, submit an evaluation of the pharmacology and toxicology of the substance in question based on reasonably available medical and scientific literature. The evaluation should be a comprehensive one, and should include proper literature citations. To the extent possible, information submitted by the petitioner justifying an exemption based on the medical and scientific literature will be evaluated under the criteria specified in \u00a7 1702.9(a) for evaluating experimental data. In certain cases where the experimental data specified by \u00a7 1702.9 (a) and (b) are unavailable, the medical and scientific literature may justify granting an exemption, particularly where the pharmacology and toxicology of the substance is well documented in the literature.",
            "(c) Optional data criteria for petitions involving substances not used in or on the human or animal body. The following types of data, although often not generated for household substances not normally used in or on the human or animal body, may be available to a petitioner and should, where reasonably available, be submitted.",
            "(1) Summary laboratory reports of data obtained in subacute and chronic animal studies where such data pertain to the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of the substance in question;",
            "(2) Results of median lethal dosage (LD50) studies conducted in additional species of animals; and",
            "(3) Any additional experimental studies relevant to the exemption request which would provide the Commission with additional means of assessing the hazards to children of the product for which exemption is sought."
