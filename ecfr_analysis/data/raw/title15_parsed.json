The performance characteristics selected are those that are of demonstrable importance to consumers, that consumers cannot evaluate through mere inspection of the product, and that can be measured objectively and reported understandably to consumers. The consumer products covered include those for which incorrect purchase decision can result in financial loss, dissatisfaction, or inconvenience. The program seeks to avoid the duplication of other Federal programs under which performance characteristics are labeled by exempting those performance characteristics from this program. However, where the Federal agency concerned agrees, the Department of Commerce may include information about those performance characteristics in CPILP labels if, by doing so, product comparison at the point of sale is simplified for consumers, and the complexity of product labeling is reduced for the manufacturers by enabling them to comply with the labeling requirements of other Federal agencies through participation in CPILP.",

            "(vi) Any incorporated place which contracts for block statistics and which reaches a population of 10,000 or more in the 1980 census will have the fee completely refunded, as the place will then be considered to be part of the regular block statistics program.",
            "(vii) If the area submits maps which are not adequate for the Bureau's purposes (see Maps, below) and therefore have to be redrafted by the Bureau, a surcharge of $300 per map sheet requiring revision will be applied to the fee for the particular area.",
            "(2) Maps: (i) In order for the Bureau to provide data on a block-by-block basis, it must have a map which clearly delineates each block. The contracting government authority must supply such maps. A copy of the specifications for preparing the block maps will be provided upon request and, in any event, will accompany the copy of the contract which is sent to the government authority for signature.",

Typically, the Census Bureau will suspend this service, and direct its resources to the decennial census, for a total of five years\u2014the two years preceding the decennial census, the decennial census year, and the two years following it. The Census Bureau will issue notices in the Federal Register announcing when it suspends and, in turn, resumes, the service.",

The Census Bureau will process requests for population certificates for standard governmental units, in accordance with the Census Bureau's annual certification schedule or under an expedited certification arrangement. The boundaries for standard governmental units are regularly and customarily updated between decennial censuses by the Census Bureau's geographic support system. These governmental units include a variety of legally defined general- and special-purpose governmental units, including counties and statistically equivalent entities, minor civil divisions, incorporated places, consolidated cities, federally recognized American Indian reservations, and school districts. A complete list of entities is defined in paragraph (c) of this section.",
            "(1) Annual certification. Annual population and housing certification is available around October 1 of each calendar year to new or existing governmental units that report legal boundary updates in the Census Bureau's annual Boundary and Annexation Survey. In accordance with reporting requirements of this survey, the legally effective dates of the boundary updates may not be later than January 1 of the calendar year. These certifications are available through September of the following year.",
            "(i) The annual certification service also is available to standard governmental units that are not in the Boundary and Annexation Survey of that year. Governmental units electing participation in this service must draft the legal boundary updates upon Census Bureau-supplied maps. The legally effective dates of the boundaries may not be later than January 1 of the calendar year. The Census Bureau must receive the census maps annotated with the legally certified boundaries and associated address ranges by April 1 of the same calendar year. The Census Bureau will determine that the legal boundary updates are acceptable by verifying that the information is complete, legible, and usable, and that the legal boundaries on the maps have been attested by the governmental unit as submitted in accordance with state law or tribal authority.",

            "(B) Certification of boundary updates reported to the Census Bureau after April 1 of the current calendar year; or",
            "(C) Certification of boundary updates by the Census Bureau before October 1 of the current calendar year.",
            "(ii) Governmental units electing participation in this service must draft the legal boundary updates upon Census Bureau-supplied maps. To allow sufficient processing time, the Census Bureau must receive acceptable census maps annotated with the legally certified boundaries and associated address ranges no later than three months before the date requested by the customer to receive the population certificate. The Census Bureau will determine that the legal boundary updates are acceptable by verifying that the information is complete, legible, and usable and that the legal boundaries on the maps have been attested as submitted in accordance with state law or tribal authority.",
            "(c) List of standard governmental units. The following is a list of the standard governmental units eligible for the Geographically Updated Population Certification Program:",

          "paragraphs": [
            "(a) Technical services. The NIST radio stations WWV at Fort Collins, Colorado, and WWVH on the island of Kauai, Hawaii, broadcast a number of technical services continuously night and day. These services are:",
            "(1) Standard radio frequencies, 2.5, 5, 10, 15, and 20, MHz (WWV) and 2.5, 5, 10, and 15 MHz (WWVH); (2) standard time signals; (3) time intervals; (4) UTI corrections; (5) standard audio frequencies; (6) standard musical pitch; (7) a slow time code; (8) Omega Navigation System status reports; (9) geophysical alerts; and (10) marine storm warnings. NIST also broadcasts time and frequency signals from its low frequency station, WWVB, also located at Fort Collins, Colorado.",
            "(2) [Reserved]",
            "(b) Time announcements. Once per minute voice announcements are made from WWV and WWVH. The two stations are distinguished by a female voice from WWVH and a male voice from WWV. The WWVH announcement occurs first, at 15 seconds before the minute, while the WWV announcement occurs at 7\n1/2 seconds before the minute. Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is used in these announcements.",
            "(c) Time corrections. The UTC time scale operates on atomic frequency, but by means of step adjustments is made to approximate the astronomical UTI scale. It may disagree from UTI by as much as 0.9 second before step adjustments of exactly 1 second are made. These adjustments, or leap seconds are required about once per year and will usually be made on December 31 or June 30. For those who need astronomical time more accurately than 0.9 second, a correction to UTC is encoded by the use of double ticks after the start of each minute. The first through the eighth seconds ticks will indicate a \u201cplus\u201d correction, and from the ninth through the 16th a \u201cminus\u201d correction. The correction is determined by counting the number of double ticks. For example, if the first, second, and third ticks are doubled, the correction is \u201cplus\u201d 0.3 second. If the ninth, 10th, 11th, and 12th ticks are doubled, the correction is \u201cminus\u201d 0.4 second.",
            "(d) Standard time intervals. An audio pulse (5 cycles of 1000 Hz on WWV and 6 cycles of 1200 Hz on WWVH), resembling the ticking of a clock, occurs each second of the minute except on the 29th and 59th seconds. Each of these 5-millisecond second pulses occur within a 40-millisecond period, wherein all other modulation (voice or tone) is removed from the carrier. These pulses begin 10 milliseconds after the modulation interruption. A long pulse (0.8 second) marks the beginning of each minute.",
            "(e) Standard frequencies. All carrier and audio frequencies occur at their nominal values according to the International System of Units (SI). For periods of 45-second duration, either 500-Hz or 600-Hz audio tones are broadcast in alternate minutes during most of each hour. A 440-Hz tone, the musical pitch A above middle C, is broadcast once per hour near the beginning of the hour.",
            "(f) Accuracy and stability. The time and frequency broadcasts are controlled by the NIST atomic frequency standards, which realize the internationally defined cesium resonance frequency with an accuracy of 1 part in 10 \n13. The frequencies transmitted by WWV and WWVH are held stable to better than \u00b12 parts in 10 \n11 at all times. Deviations at WWV are normally less than 1 part in 10 \n12 from day to day. Incremental frequency adjustments not exceeding 1 part in 10 \n12 are made at WWV and WWVH as necessary. Changes in the propagation medium (causing Doppler effect, diurnal shifts, etc.) result in fluctuations in the carrier frequencies as received which may be very much greater than the uncertainties described above.",
            "(g) Slow time code. A modified IRIG H time code occurs continuously on a 100-Hz subcarrier. The format is 1 pulse per second with a 1-minute time frame. It gives day of the year, hours, and minutes in binary coded decimal form.",
            "(h) Omega announcements. Omega Navigation System status reports are broadcast in voice from WWV at 16 minutes after the hour and from WWVH at 47 minutes after the hour. The international Omega Navigation System is a very low frequency (VLF) radio navigation aid operating in the 10 to 14 kHz frequency band. Eight stations are in operation around the world. Omega, like other radio navigation systems, is subject to signal degradation caused by ionospheric disturbances at high latitudes. The Omega announcements on WWV and WWVH are given to provide users with immediate notification of such events and other information on the status of the Omega system.",
            "(i) Geophysical alerts. These occur in voice at the 18th minute of each hour from WWV. They point out outstanding events which are in process, followed by a summary of selected solar and geophysical events in the past 24 hours and a forecast for the next 24 hours. They are provided by the Space Environment Laboratory, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Boulder, CO 80303.",
            "(j) Marine storm information. Weather information about major storms in the Atlantic and eastern North Pacific are broadcast in voice from WWV at 8, 9, and 10 minutes after each hour. Similar storm warnings covering the eastern and central North Pacific are given from WWVH at 48, 49, and 50 minutes after each hour. An additional segment (at 11 minutes after the hour on WWV and at 51 minutes on WWVH) may be used when there are unusually widespread storm conditions. The brief messages are designed to tell mariners of storm threats in their areas. If there are no warnings in the designated areas, the broadcasts will so indicate. The ocean areas involved are those for which the U.S. has warning responsibility under international agreement. The regular times of issue by the National Weather Service are 0500, 1100, 1700, and 2300 UTC for WWV and 0000, 0600, 1200, and 1800 UTC for WWVH. These broadcasts are updated effective with the next scheduled announcement following the time of issue.",
            "(k) \u201cSilent\u201d periods. These are periods with no tone modulation during which the carrier, seconds ticks, minute time announcements, and 100 Hz modified IRIG H time code continue. They occur during the 16th through the 20th minute on WWVH and the 46th through the 51st minute on WWV.",
            "(l) WWVB. This station (antenna coordinates 40\u00b040\u203228.3\u2033 N., 105\u00b002\u203239.5\u2033 W.; radiated power 12 kw.) broadcasts on 60 kHz. Its time scale is the same as for WWV and WWVH, and its frequency accuracy and stability are the same. Its entire format consists of a 1 pulse per second special binary time code giving minutes, hours, days, and the correction between its UTC time scale and UTI astronomical time. Identification of WWVB is made by its unique time code and a 45\u00b0 carrier phase shift which occurs for the period between 10 minutes and 15 minutes after each hour. The useful coverage area of WWVB is within the continental United States. Propagation fluctuations are much less with WWVB than with high-frequency reception, permitting frequency comparisons to be made to a few parts in 10 \n11 per day.",

Repairs and adjustments on apparatus submitted should be attended to by the owner, since NIST will not undertake them except by special arrangement. Apparatus not in good condition will not be calibrated. If defects are found after calibration has begun, the effort may be terminated, a report issued summarizing such information as has been found, and a fee charged in accordance with the amount of work done.",

Suggestions on packing and shipping are made in some sections of SP 250. In every case, the sender should consider the nature of the apparatus, pack it accordingly, and clearly label shipments containing fragile instruments or materials, such as glass and the like.",

As an aid in preventing loss of such containers, the customer's name should be legibly and permanently marked on the outside. In order to prolong the container's use the notation \u201cREUSABLE CONTAINER, DO NOT DESTROY\u201d should be marked on the outside.",

The customer must pay shipping charges to and from NIST; shipments from NIST will be made collect. The method of return transportation should be stated, and it is recommeded that return shipments be insured, since NIST will not assume liability for their loss or damage. For long-distance shipping it is found that air express and air freight provide an advantage in reduction of time in transit. If return shipment by parcel post is requested or is a suitable mode of transportation, shipments will be prepaid by NIST, but without covering insurance. When no shipping or insurance instructions are furnished, return shipment will be made by common carrier collect, but uninsured.",
            "(e) NIST will not be responsible for the risk of loss or damage to any item during shipment to or from NIST. Any arrangements for insurance covering this risk must be made by the customer. Return shipment will be made by NIST as indicated in paragraph (d) of this section. The purchase order should always show the value of the equipment, and if transit insurance is carried by the customer, this fact should be stated.",

Some types of instruments may require considerably longer, particularly if their abnormal behavior requires reruns to check reliability. The customer who can spare the instrument for only a short time can usually arrange by letter or telephone call for shipping it to NIST just as the assigned starting date approaches. A notice will be sent acknowledging receipt of the customer's standard and/or purchase order.

The International System of Units (SI) was defined and given official status by the 11th General Conference of Weights and Measures, 1960. A complete listing of SI units is presented in detail in NIST SP 330. The NIST will express data in SI units unless this makes communication excessively complicated. For example, commercial gage designations, commonly used items identified by nominal dimensions, or other commercial nomenclatures or devices (such as drill sizes, or commercial standards for weights and measures) expressed in customary units are an exception from this practice. However, even in such instances, when practical and meaningful, SI and customary units may be given in parallel. Users of NIST calibration services may specify the units to be used in the calibration, especially for commercial devices and standards using customary units or units having some legal definition."

Each Center shall be affiliated with a U.S.-based nonprofit institution or organization which has submitted a qualified proposal for a Center Operating Award under these procedures. Support may be provided for a period not to exceed six years. The Centers work with industry, universities, nonprofit economic development organizations and state governments to transfer advanced manufacturing technologies, processes, and methods as defined in \u00a7 290.2 to small and medium sized firms. These technology transfer efforts focus on the continuous and incremental improvement of the target firms. The advanced manufacturing technology which is the focus of the Centers is the subject of research in NIST's Automated Manufacturing Research Facility (AMRF). The core of AMRF research has principally been applied in discrete part manufacturing, including electronics, composites, plastics, and metal parts fabrication and assembly. Centers will be afforded the opportunity for interaction with the AMRF and will be given access to reasearch projects and results to strengthen their technology transfer. Where elements of a solution are available from an existing source, they should be employed. Where private-sector consultants who can meet the needs of a small- or medium-sized manufacturer are available, they should handle the task. Each Center should bring to bear the technology expertise described in \u00a7 290.3(d) to assist small- and medium-sized manufacturing firms in adopting advanced manufacturing technology.",

            "(d) Center organization and operation. Each Center will be organized to transfer advanced manufacturing technology to small and medium sized manufacturers located in its service region. Regional Centers will be established and operated via cooperative agreements between NIST and the award-receiving organizations. Individual awards shall be decided on the basis of merit review, geographical diversity, and the availability of funding.",
            "(e) Leverage. The Centers program must concentrate on approaches which can be applied to other companies, in other regions, or by other organizations. The lessons learned in assisting a particular target firm should be documented in order to facilitate the use of those lessons by other target firms. A Center should build on unique solutions developed for a single company to develop techniques of broad applicability. It should seek wide implementation with well-developed mechanisms for distribution of results. Leverage is the principle of developing less resource-intensive methods of delivering technologies (as when a Center staff person has the same impact on ten firms as was formerly obtained with the resources used for one, or when a project once done by the Center can be carried out for dozens of companies by the private sector or a state or local organization.) Leverage does not imply a larger non-federal funding match (that is, greater expenditure of non-federal dollars for each federal dollar) but rather a greater impact per dollar.",
            "(f) Regional impact. A new Center should not begin by spreading its resources too thinly over too large a geographic area. It should concentrate first on establishing its structure, operating style, and client base within a manageable service area."

These articles may be transferred to another qualified nonprofit institution, but any commercial use within five years of entry shall result in the assessment of applicable duties pursuant to \u00a7 301.9(c).",
            "(2) An institution wishing to enter an instrument or apparatus under tariff subheading 9810.00.60, HTSUS, must file an application with the Customs and Border Protection in accordance with the regulations in this section. If the application is made in accordance with the regulations, notice of the application is published in the Federal Register to provide an opportunity for interested persons and government agencies to present views. The application is reviewed by the Secretary of Commerce (Director, Statutory Import Programs Staff) , who decides whether or not duty-free entry may be accorded the instrument and publishes the decision in the Federal Register. An appeal of the final decision may be filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, on questions of law only, within 20 days after publication in the Federal Register.",
            "(3) Repair components for instruments or apparatus admitted duty-free under subheading 9810.00.60, HTSUS require no application and may be entered duty-free in accordance with the procedures prescribed in \u00a7 301.10.",
            "(4) Tools specifically designed to be used for the maintenance, checking, gauging or repair of instruments or apparatus admitted under subheadings 9810.00.65 and 9810.00.67, HTSUS, require no application and may be entered duty-free in accordance with the procedures prescribed in \u00a7 301.10.",
            "(d) Authority and delegations. The Act authorizes the Secretaries of Commerce and the Treasury to prescribe joint regulations to carry out their functions under U.S. Note 6, Subchapter X, Chapter 98, HTSUS. The Secretary of the Treasury has delegated authority to the Assistant Secretary for Enforcement, who has retained rulemaking authority and further delegated administration of the regulations to the Commissioner of the Customs and Border Protection. The authority of the Secretary of Commerce has been delegated to the Assistant Secretary for Enforcement and Compliance who has retained rulemaking authority and further delegated administration of the regulations to the Director of the Statutory Import Programs Staff."

            "(c) CBP Port\u201d or the Port means the port where a particular claim has been or will be made for duty-free entry of a scientific instrument or apparatus under subheading 9810.00.60, HTSUS.",
            "(d) Entry means entry of an instrument into the Customs territory of the United States for consumption or withdrawal of an instrument from a Customs bonded warehouse for consumption.",
            "(e) United States includes only the several States, the District of Columbia and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.",
            "(f) Instrument means instruments and apparatus specified in U.S. Note 6(a), Subchapter X, Chapter 98, HTSUS. A combination of basic instrument or apparatus and accompanying accessories shall be treated as a single instrument provided that, under normal commercial practice, such combination is considered to be a single instrument and provided further that the applicant has ordered or, upon favorable action on its application, firmly intends to order the combination as a unit. The term \u201cinstrument\u201d also covers separable components of an instrument that are imported for assembly in the United States in such instrument where that instrument, due to its size, cannot feasibly be imported in its assembled state. The components, as well as the assembled instrument itself, must be classifiable under the tariff provisions listed in U.S. Note 6(a), Subchapter X, Chapter 98, HTSUS. See paragraph (k) of this section and \u00a7 301.3(f). Unless the context indicates otherwise, instrument or apparatus shall mean a foreign \u201cinstrument or apparatus\u201d for which duty-free entry is sought under subheading 9810.00.60, HTSUS. Spare parts typically ordered and delivered with an instrument are also considered part of an instrument for purposes of these regulations. The term \u201cinstruments\u201d shall not include:",
            "(1) Materials or supplies used in the operation of instruments and apparatus such as paper, cards, tapes, ink, recording materials, expendable laboratory materials, apparatus that loses identity or is consumed by usage or other materials or supplies.",
            "(2) Ordinary equipment for use in building construction or maintenance; or equipment for use in supporting activities of the institution, such as its administrative offices, machine shops, libraries, centralized computer facilities, eating facilities, or religious facilities; or support equipment such as copying machines, glass working apparatus and film processors.",
            "(3) General purpose equipment such as air conditioners, electric typewriters, electric drills, refrigerators.",
            "(4) General-purpose computers. Accessories to computers which are not eligible for duty-free treatment are also ineligible. Scientific instruments containing embedded computers which are to be used in a dedicated process or in instrument control, as opposed to general data processing or computation, are, however, eligible for duty-free consideration.",
            "(5) Instruments initially imported solely for testing or review purposes which were entered under bond under subheading 9813.00.30, HTSUS, subject to the provisions of U.S. Note 1(a), Subchapter XIII, Chapter 98, HTSUS, and must be exported or destroyed within the time period specified in that U.S. Note.",
            "(g) Domestic instrument means an instrument which is manufactured in the United States. A domestic instrument need not be made exclusively of domestic components or accessories.",
            "(h) Accessory has the meaning which it has under normal commercial usage. An accessory, whether part of an instrument or an attachment to an instrument, adds to the capability of an instrument. An accessory for which duty-free entry is sought under subheading 9810.00.60, HTSUS shall be the subject of a separate application when it is not an accompanying accessory. The existing instrument, for which the accessory is being purchased, may be domestic or, if foreign, it need not have entered duty free under subheading 9810.00.60, HTSUS.",
            "(i) Accompanying accessory means an accessory for an instrument that is listed as an item in the same purchase order and that is necessary for accomplishment of the purposes for which the instrument is intended to be used.",
            "(j) Ancillary equipment means an instrument which may be functionally related to the foreign instrument but is not operationally linked to it. Examples of ancillary equipment are vacuum evaporators or ultramicrotomes, which can be used to prepare specimens for electron microscopy. Further, equipment which is compatible with the foreign instrument, but is also clearly compatible with similar domestic instruments, such as a vacuum evaporator sold for use with an electron microscope, will be treated as ancillary equipment. A separate application will be required for ancillary equipment even if ordered with the basic instrument.",
            "(k) Components of an instrument means parts or assemblies of parts which are substantially less than the instrument to which they relate. A component enables an instrument to function at a specified minimum level, while an accessory adds to the capability of an instrument. Applications shall not be accepted for components of instruments that did not enter duty-free under subheading 9810.00.60, HTSUS or for components of instruments being manufactured or assembled by a commercial firm or entity in the U.S. In determining whether an item is a component ineligible for duty-free consideration or an accessory eligible for such consideration, Customs and Border Protection shall take into account such factors as the item's complexity, novelty, degree of integration and pertinency to the research purposes to be performed by the instrument as a whole. The above notwithstanding, separable components of some instruments may be eligible for duty-free treatment. See paragraph (f) of this section.",
            "(l) Produced for stock means an instrument which is manufactured, on sale and available from a stock.",
            "(m) Produced on order means an instrument which a manufacturer lists in current catalog literature and is able and willing to produce and have available without unreasonable delay to the applicant.",
            "(n) Custom-made means an instrument which a manufacturer is willing and able to make to purchaser's specifications. Instruments resulting from a development effort are treated as custom-made for the purposes of these regulations. Also, a special-order variant of a produced on order instrument, with significant modifications specified by the applicant, may be treated as custom-made.",
            "(o) Same general category means the category in which an instrument is customarily classified in trade directories and product-source lists, e.g., scanning electron microscope, light microscope.",
            "(p) Comparable domestic instrument means a domestic instrument capable or potentially capable of fulfilling the applicant's technical requirements or intended uses, whether or not in the same general category as the foreign instrument.",
            "(q) Specifications means the particulars of the structural, operational and performance characteristics or capabilities of a scientific instrument.",
            "(r) Guaranteed specifications are those specifications which are an explicit part of the contractual agreement between the buyer and the seller (or which would become part of the agreement if the buyer accepted the seller's offer), and refer only to the minimum and routinely achievable performance levels of the instrument under specified conditions. If a capability is listed or quoted as a range (e.g., \u201c5 to 10 nanometers\u201d) or as a minimum that may be exceeded (e.g., \u201c5 angstroms or better\u201d), only the inferior capability may be considered the guaranteed specification. Evidence that specifications are \u201cguaranteed\u201d will normally consist of their being printed in a brochure or other descriptive literature of the manufacturer; being listed in a purchase agreement upon which the purchase is conditioned; or appearing in a manufacturer's formal response to a request for quote. If, however, no opportunity to submit a bid was afforded the domestic manufacturer or if, for any other reason, comparable guaranteed specifications of the foreign and domestic instruments do not appear on the record, other evidence relating to a manufacturer's ability to provide an instrument with comparable specifications may, at the discretion of the Director, be considered in the comparison of the foreign and domestic instruments' capabilities. Performance results on a test sample run at the applicant's request may be cited as evidence for or against a guaranteed specification.",
            "(s) Pertinent specifications are those specifications necessary for the accomplishment of the specific scientific research or science-related educational purposes described by the applicant. Specifications of features (even if guaranteed) which afford greater convenience, satisfy personal preferences, accommodate institutional commitments or limitations, or assure lower costs of acquisition, installation, operation, servicing or maintenance are not pertinent. For example, a design feature, such as a small number of knobs or controls on an instrument primarily designed for research purposes, would be a convenience. The ability to fit an instrument into a small room, when the required operations could be performed in a larger room, would be either a cost consideration or a matter of convenience and not a pertinent specification. In addition, mere difference in design (which would, for example, broaden the educational experience of students but not provide superior scientific capability) would not be pertinent. Also, characteristics such as size, weight, appearance, durability, reliability, complexity (or simplicity), ease of operation, ease of maintenance, productivity, versatility, \u201cstate of the art\u201d design, specific design and compatibility with currently owned or ordered equipment are not pertinent unless the applicant demonstrates that the characteristic is necessary for the accomplishment of its scientific purposes."

            "(a) Public notice and opportunity to present views. (1) Within 5 days of receipt of an application from the Commissioner, the Director shall make a copy available for public inspection during ordinary business hours of the Department of Commerce. Unless the Director determines that an application has deficiencies which preclude consideration on its merits (e.g., insufficient description of intended purposes to rule on the scientific equivalency of the foreign instrument and potential domestic equivalents), he shall publish in the Federal Register a notice of the receipt of the application to afford all interested persons a reasonable opportunity to present their views with respect to the question \u201cwhether an instrument or apparatus of equivalent scientific value for the purpose for which the article is intended to be used is being manufactured in the United States.\u201d The notice will include the application number, the name and address of the applicant, a description of the instrument(s) for which duty-free entry is requested, the name of the foreign manufacturer and a brief summary of the applicant's intended purposes extracted from the applicant's answer to question 7 of the application.

The Director may attach conditions and time limitations upon the provision of such information and may draw appropriate inferences from a person's failure to provide the requested information.",
            "(c) Advice from technical consultants. (1) The Director shall consider any written advice from the Secretary of HHS, or his delegate, on the question whether a domestic instrument of equivalent scientific value to the foreign instrument, for the purposes for which the instrument is intended to be used, is being manufactured in the United States.",
            "(2) After the comment period has ended (\u00a7 301.5(a)(3)), the complete application and any comments received and related information are forwarded to appropriate technical consultants for their advice.",
            "(3) The technical consultants relied upon for advice include, but are not limited to, the National Institutes of Health (delegated the function by the Secretary of HHS), the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration.",
            "(d) Criteria for the determinations of the Department of Commerce\u2014(1) Scientific equivalency. (i) The determination of scientific equivalency shall be based on a comparison of the pertinent specifications of the foreign instrument with similar pertinent specifications of comparable domestic instruments (see \u00a7 301.2(s) for the definition of pertinent specification). Ordinarily, the Director will consider only those performance characteristics which are \u201cguaranteed specifications\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 301.2(r) of this part. In no event, however, shall the Director consider performance capabilities superior to the manufacturer's guaranteed specifications or their equivalent. In making the comparison the Director may consider a reasonable combination of domestic instruments that brings together two or more functions into an integrated unit if the combination of domestic instruments is capable of accomplishing the purposes for which the foreign instrument is intended to be used. If the Director finds that a domestic instrument possesses all of the pertinent specifications of the foreign instrument, he shall find that there is being manufactured in the United States an instrument of equivalent scientific value for such purposes as the foreign instrument is intended to be used. If the Director finds that the foreign instrument possesses one or more pertinent specifications not possessed by the comparable domestic instrument, the Director shall find that there is not being manufactured in the United States an instrument of equivalent scientific value to the foreign instrument for such purposes as the foreign instrument is intended to be used.",
            "(ii) Programs that may be undertaken at some unspecified future date shall not be considered in the Director's comparison. In making the comparison, the Director shall consider only the instrument and accompanying accessories described in the application and determined eligible by the Customs and Border Protection. The Director shall not consider the planned purchase of additional accessories or the planned adaptation of the article at some unspecified future time.",
            "(iii) In order for the Director to make a determination with respect to the \u201cscientific equivalency\u201d of the foreign and domestic instruments, the applicant's intended purposes must include either scientific research or science-related educational programs. Instruments used exclusively for nonscientific purposes have no scientific value, thereby precluding the requisite finding by the Director with respect to \u201cwhether an instrument or apparatus of equivalent scientific value to such article, for the purposes for which the article is intended to be used, is being manufactured in the United States.\u201d In such cases the Director shall deny the application for the reason that the instrument has no scientific value for the purposes for which it is intended to be used. Examples of nonscientific purposes would be the use of an instrument in routine diagnosis or patient care and therapy (as opposed to clinical research); in teaching a nonscientific trade (e.g., printing, shoemaking, metalworking or other types of vocational training); in teaching nonscientific courses (e.g., music, home economics, journalism, drama); in presenting a variety of subjects or merely for presenting coursework, whether or not science related (e.g., video tape editors, tape recorders, projectors); and in conveying cultural information to the public (e.g., a planetarium in the Smithsonian Institution).",
            "(2) Manufactured in the United States. An instrument shall be considered as being manufactured in the United States if it is customarily \u201cproduced for stock,\u201d \u201cproduced on order\u201d or \u201ccustom-made\u201d within the United States. In determining whether a U.S. manufacturer is able and willing to produce an instrument, and have it available without unreasonable delay, the normal commercial practices applicable to the production and delivery of instruments of the same general category shall be taken into account, as well as other factors which in the Director's judgment are reasonable to take into account under the circumstances of a particular case. For example, in determining whether a domestic manufacturer is able to produce a custom-made instrument, the Director may take into account the production experience of the domestic manufacturer including (i) the types, complexity and capabilities of instruments the manufacturer has produced, (ii) the extent of the technological gap between the instrument to which the application relates and the manufacturer's customary products, (iii) the manufacturer's technical skills, (iv) the degree of saturation of the manufacturer's production capability, and (v) the time required by the domestic manufacturer to produce the instrument to the purchaser's specification. Whether or not the domestic manufacturer has field tested or demonstrated the instrument will not, in itself, enter into the decision regarding the manufacturer's ability to manufacture an instrument. Similarly, in determining whether a domestic manufacturer is willing to produce an instrument, the Director may take into account the nature of the bid process, the manufacturer's policy toward manufacture of the product(s) in question, the minimum size of the manufacturer's production runs, whether the manufacturer has bid similar instruments in the past, etc. Also, if a domestic manufacturer was formally requested to bid an instrument, without reference to cost limitations and within a leadtime considered reasonable for the category of instrument involved, and the domestic manufacturer failed formally to respond to the request, for the purposes of this section the domestic manufacturer would not be considered willing to have supplied the instrument.",
            "(3) Burden of proof. The burden of proof shall be on the applicant to demonstrate that no instrument of equivalent scientific value for the purposes for which the foreign instrument is to be used is being manufactured in the United States. Evidence of applicant favoritism towards the foreign manufacturer (advantages not extended to domestic firms, such as additional lead time, know-how, methods, data on pertinent specifications or intended uses, results of research or development, tools, jigs, fixtures, parts, materials or test equipment) may be, at the Director's discretion, grounds for rejecting the application.",
            "(4) Excessive delivery time. Duty-free entry of the instrument shall be considered justified without regard to whether there is being manufactured in the United States an instrument of equivalent scientific value for the intended purposes if excessive delivery time for the domestic instrument would seriously impair the accomplishment of the applicant's intended purposes. For purposes of this section, (i) except when objective and convincing evidence is presented that, at the time of order, the actual delivery time would significantly exceed quoted delivery time, no claim of excessive delivery time may be made unless the applicant has afforded the domestic manufacturer an opportunity to quote and the delivery time for the domestic instrument exceeds that for the foreign instrument; and (ii) failure by the domestic manufacturer to quote a specific delivery time shall be considered a non-responsive bid (see \u00a7 301.5(d)(2)). In determining whether the difference in delivery times cited by the applicant justifies duty-free entry on the basis of excessive delivery time, the Director shall take into account (A) the normal commercial practice applicable to the production of the general category of instrument involved; (B) the efforts made by the applicant to secure delivery of the instruments (both foreign and domestic) in the shortest possible time; and (C) such other factors as the Director finds relevant under the circumstances of a particular case.",
            "(5) Processing of applications for components. (i) The Director may process an application for components which are to be assembled in the United States into an instrument or apparatus which, due to its size, cannot be imported in its assembled state (see \u00a7 301.2(k)) as if it were an application for the assembled instrument. A finding by the Director that no equivalent instrument is being manufactured in the United States shall, subject to paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this section, qualify all the associated components, provided they are entered within the period established by the Director, taking into account both the scientific needs of the importing institution and the potential for development of related domestic manufacturing capacity.",
            "(ii) Notwithstanding a finding under paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section that no equivalent instrument is being manufactured in the United States, the Director shall disqualify a particular component for duty-free treatment if the Director finds that the component is being manufactured in the United States.",
            "(e) Denial without prejudice to resubmission (DWOP). The Director may, at any stage in the processing of an application by the Department of Commerce, DWOP an application if it contains any deficiency which, in the Director's judgment, prevents a determination on its merits. The Director shall state the deficiencies of the application in the DWOP letter to the applicant.",
            "(1) The applicant has 60 days from the date of the DWOP to correct the cited deficiencies in the application unless a request for an extension of time for submission of the supplemental information has been received by the Director prior to the expiration of the 60-day period and is approved.",
            "(2) If granted, extensions of time will generally be limited to 30 days.",
            "(3) Resubmissions must reference the application number of the earlier submission. The resubmission may be made by letter to the Director. The record of a resubmitted application shall include the original submission on file with the Department. Any new material or information contained in a resubmission, which should address the specific deficiencies cited in the DWOP letter, should be clearly labeled and referenced to the applicable question on the application form. The resubmission must be for the instrument covered by the original application unless the DWOP letter specifies to the contrary. The resubmission shall be subject to the certification made on the original application.",
            "(4) If the applicant fails to resubmit within the applicable time period, the prior DWOP shall, irrespective of the merits of the case, result in a denial of the application.",
            "(5) The Director shall use the postmark date of the fully completed resubmission in determining whether the resubmission was made within the allowable time period. Certified or registered mail, or some other means which can unequivocally establish the date of mailing, is recommended. Resubmission by fax, e-mail or other electronic means is acceptable provided an appropriate return number or address is provided in the transmittal. Resubmissions must clearly indicate the date of transmittal to the Director.",
            "(6) The applicant may, at any time prior to the end of the resubmission period, notify the Director in writing that it does not intend to resubmit the application. Upon such notification, the application will be deemed to have been withdrawn. (See \u00a7 301.5(g).)",
            "(7) Information provided in a resubmission that, in the judgment of the Director, contradicts or conflicts with information provided in a prior submission, or is not a reasonable extension of the information contained in the prior submission, shall not be considered in making the decision on an application that has been resubmitted. Accordingly, an applicant may elect to reinforce an orginal submission by elaborating in the resubmission on the description of the purposes contained in a prior submission and may supply additional examples, documentation and/or other clarifying detail, but the applicant shall not introduce new purposes or other material changes in the nature of the original application. The resubmission should address the specific deficiencies cited in the DWOP. The Director may draw appropriate inferences from the failure of an applicant to attempt to provide the information requested in the DWOP.",
            "(8) In the event an applicant fails to address the noted deficiencies in the response to the DWOP, the Director may deny the application.",
            "(f) Decisions on applications. The Director shall prepare a written decision granting or denying each application. However, when he deems appropriate, the Director may issue a consolidated decision on two or more applications. The Director shall promptly forward a copy of the decision to each applicant institution and to the Federal Register for publication.",
            "(g) Withdrawal of applications. The Director shall discontinue processing an application withdrawn by the applicant and shall publish notice of such withdrawal in the Federal Register. If at any time while its application is pending before the Director, either during the intital application or resubmission stage, an applicant cancels an order for the instrument to which the application relates or ceases to have a firm intention to order such instrument or apparatus, the institution shall promptly notify the Director. Such notification shall constitute a withdrawal. Withdrawals shall be considered as having been finally denied for purposes of \u00a7 301.7(c) below.",
            "(h) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as limiting the Director's discretion at any stage of processing to insert into the record and consider in making his decision any information in the public domain which he deems relevant."

            "Failure to follow the procedures in this section may disqualify an instrument for duty-free entry notwithstanding an approval of an application on its merits by the Department of Commerce.",
            "(a) Entry procedures. (1) An applicant desiring duty-free entry of an instrument may make a claim at the time of entry of the instrument into the Customs territory of the United States (as defined in 19 CFR 101.1) that the instrument is entitled to duty-free classification under subheading 9810.00.60, HTSUS.",
            "(2) If no such claim is made the instrument shall be immediately classified without regard to subheading 9810.00.60, HTSUS , duty will be assessed, and the entry liquidated in the ordinary course.",
            "(3) If a claim is made for duty-free entry under subheading 9810.00.60, HTSUS , the entry shall be accepted without requiring a deposit of estimated duties provided that a copy of the form, stamped by Customs and Border Protection as accepted for transmittal to the Department of Commerce in accordance with \u00a7 301.4(b), is filed simultaneously with the entry.",
            "(4) If a claim for duty-free entry under subheading 9810.00.60, HTSUS is made but is not accompanied by a copy of the properly stamped form, a deposit of the estimated duty is required. Before the entry is liquidated, the applicant must file with the CBP Port a properly stamped copy of the application form. In the event that the CBP Port does not receive a copy of the properly stamped application form before liquidation, the instrument shall be classified and liquidated in the ordinary course, without regard for subheading 9810.00.60, HTSUS.",
            "(5) Entry of an instrument after the Director's approval of an application. Whenever an institution defers entry until after it receives a favorable final determination on the application for duty-free entry of the instrument, either by delaying importation or by placing the instrument in a bonded warehouse or foreign trade zone, the importer shall file with the entry of the instrument (i) the stamped copy of the form, (ii) the institution's copy of the favorable final determination and (iii) proof that a bona fide order for the merchandise was placed on or before the 60th day after the favorable decision became final pursuant to \u00a7 301.7 of these regulations. Liquidation in such case shall be made under subheading 9810.00.60, HTSUS.",
            "(b) Normal Customs and Border Protection entry requirements. In addition to the entry requirements in paragraph (a) of this section, the normal Customs and Border Protection entry requirements must be met. In most of the cases, the value of the merchandise will be such that the formal Customs and Border Protection entry requirements, which generally include the filing of a Customs and Border Protection entry bond, must be complied with. (For further information, see 19 CFR 142.3 and 142.4 (TD-221).)",
            "(c) Late filing. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this section any document, form, or statement required by regulations in this section to be filed in connection with the entry may be filed at any time before liquidation of the entry becomes final, provided that failure to file at the time of entry or within the period for which a bond was filed for its production was not due to willful negligence or fraudulent intent. Liquidation of any entry becomes conclusive upon all persons if the liquidation is not protested in writing in accordance with 19 CFR part 174, or the necessary document substantiating duty-free entry is not produced in accordance with 19 CFR 10.112. Upon notice of such final and conclusive liquidation, the Department of Commerce will cease the processing of any pending application for duty-free entry of the subject article. In all other respects, the provisions of this section do not apply to Department of Commerce responsibilities and procedures for processing applications pursuant to other sections of these regulations.",
            "(d) Payment of duties. The importer of record will be billed for payment of duties when Customs and Border Protection determines that such payment is due. If a refund of a deposit made pursuant to paragraph (a)(4) of this section is due, the importer should contact Customs and Border Protection officials at the port of entry, not the Department of Commerce."

L. 91-269 (84 Stat. 271, 22 U.S.C. 2801 et seq.) which establishes an orderly procedure for Federal Government recognition of, and participation in, international expositions to be held in the United States. The Act provides, inter alia, that Federal recognition of an exposition is to be granted upon a finding by the President that such recognition will be in the national interest. In making this finding, the President is directed to consider, among other factors, a report from the Secretary of Commerce as to the purposes and reasons for an exposition and the extent of financial and other support to be provided by the State and local officials and business and community leaders where the exposition is to be held, and a report by the Secretary of State to determine whether the exposition is qualified for registration under Bureau of International Expositions (BIE) rules. The BIE is an international organization established by the Paris Convention of 1928 (T.I.A.S. 6548 as amended by T.I.A.S. 6549) to regulate the conduct and scheduling of international expositions in which foreign nations are officially invited to participate. The BIE divides international expositions into different categories and types and requires each member nation to observe specified minimum time intervals in scheduling each of these categories and types of expositions. \n1\n Under BIE rules, member nations may not ordinarily participate in an international exposition unless such exposition has been approved by the BIE. The United States became a member of the BIE on April 30, 1968, upon ratification of the Paris Convention by the U.S. Senate (114 Cong. Rec. 11012)."

Company A, a U.S. firm, contracts for Company B, a foreign firm located in country C, to produce a component of a U.S.-origin defense article subject to an offset agreement between Company A and country C. The defense article will be sold to country C pursuant to a Foreign Military Sale and the production role of Company B is described in the Letter of Offer and Acceptance associated with that sale and a government-to-government co-production memorandum of understanding. This transaction would be categorized as co-production and would, like all co-production transactions, be direct.",
            "(2) Example 2. Company A, a U.S. firm, transfers technology to Company B, a foreign firm located in country C, which allows Company B to conduct research and development directly related to a defense article that is subject to an offset agreement between Company A and country C. This transaction would be categorized as technology transfer and would be direct because the research and development is directly related to an item subject to the offset agreement.",
            "(3) Example 3. Company A, a U.S. firm, contracts for Company B, a foreign firm located in country C, to produce a component of a U.S.-origin defense article subject to an offset agreement between Company A and country C. The contract with Company B is for a direct commercial sale and Company A does not license Company B to use any technology. The transaction would be categorized as subcontracting and would, like all subcontracting transactions, be direct.",
            "(4) Example 4. Company A, a U.S. firm, makes arrangements for a line of credit at a financial institution for Company B, a foreign firm located in country C, so that Company B can produce an item that is not subject to the offset agreement between Company A and country C. The transaction would be categorized as credit assistance and would be indirect because the credit assistance is unrelated to an item covered by the offset agreement.",
            "(5) Example 5. Company A, a U.S. firm, arranges for training of personnel from Company B, a foreign firm located in country C. The training is related to the production and maintenance of a U.S.-origin defense article that is subject to an offset agreement between Company A and country C. The transaction would be categorized as training and would be direct because the training is directly related to the production and maintenance of an item covered by the offset agreement.",
            "(6) Example 6. Company A, a U.S. firm, contracts for Company B, a foreign firm located in country C, to produce a component of a U.S.-origin defense article that is subject to an offset agreement between Company A and country C. The contract with Company B is a Foreign Military Sale and Company A licenses Company B to use Company A's production technology to produce the component. There is no co-production agreement between the United States and country C. The transaction would be categorized as licensed production and would be direct because it involves the item covered by the offset agreement.",
            "(7) Example 7. Company A, a U.S. firm, makes an investment in Company B, a foreign firm located in country C, so that Company B can create a new production line to produce a component of a defense article that is subject to an offset agreement between Company A and country C.

Company A, a U.S. firm, purchases various off-the-shelf items from Company B, a foreign firm located in country C, but none of these items will be used by Company A to produce the defense article subject to the offset agreement between Company A and country C.

            "(a) Requirement to comply. Every person who receives a survey or other request for information issued pursuant to this part must submit a complete and adequate response to BIS within the time frame stated on the initial distribution letter or other request for information. Survey response information that does not adhere to the survey question criteria or that contains only aggregate information in place of specified information will be treated as inadequate and therefore noncompliant. BIS may exempt persons from this requirement for the reasons in paragraph (b) of this section, or grant extensions of time to comply as set forth in paragraph (c) of this section. Submitting a request to BIS for an exemption or an extension of time for completion does not suspend the initial deadline required by BIS (or any extended deadline subsequently granted by BIS). Thus, persons who request an exemption or extension of time are advised to proceed as if the response is required by the deadline until advised otherwise by BIS.",
            "(b) Grounds for exemption. (1) An exemption from the requirements of this section may be granted if the person receiving the survey or other request for information:",
            "(i) Has no physical presence in the United States of any kind;",
            "(ii) Does not provide, produce, distribute, utilize, procure, research, develop, consult or advise on, or have any other direct or indirect association with the materials, products, services or technology that are within the scope of the survey;",
            "(iii) Has ceased business operations more than 12 months prior to receipt of the survey;",
            "(iv) Has been in business for less than one year; or",
            "(v) BIS determines that extenuating circumstances exist that make responding impractical.",
            "(2) BIS may also grant an exemption if, based on the totality of the circumstances, it concludes that compliance would be impractical and/or that requiring compliance would be unduly time intensive.",
            "(3) Existence of a pre-existing private non-disclosure agreement or information sharing agreement between a person and another party (e.g., customers, suppliers, etc.), does not exempt a person from the obligation to comply with and complete a survey. The authority to conduct the survey and comply with the survey is derived from the DPA, and that statutory obligation to comply supersedes any private agreement.",
            "(c) Extensions of time to complete. A person who receives a survey or other request for information may request an extension of time to submit the complete response to BIS. BIS may grant such an extension of time, if, in its judgment, circumstances are such that additional time reasonably is needed, the extension would not jeopardize timely completion of BIS's overall analysis, and the person is making reasonable progress towards completing the survey or response to the other request for information. Generally, extensions will be for no more than two weeks. A person who receives a survey or other request for information may request successive extensions if the person believes that it continues to have a legitimate need for additional time to complete the survey. BIS will not grant extensions that would jeopardize the performance and timely completion of its industrial base assessments.",
            "(d) Procedure for requesting exemptions or extensions of time. Requests for exemptions or extensions of time must be made to BIS at the telephone number, email address or BIS physical address provided in the initial distribution letter for a survey or in the other request for information. A request for an exemption must provide factual information and documentation that are adequate for BIS to determine that one or more of the criteria stated in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section are met.",
            "(e) Responses that are incomplete or inadequate. BIS may return responses that are incomplete or inadequate to the person for prompt completion. BIS will specify the required period of time permitted for completion and submission of the revised survey."

If you choose to submit declarations and reports by electronic means, all such electronic submissions must be made through the Web-Data Entry System for Industry (Web-DESI), which can be accessed on the CWC web site at www.cwc.gov.",
            "(b) Authorization. If you or your company has a facility, plant site, or trading company that has been assigned a U.S. Code Number (USC Number), you may submit declarations and reports electronically, once you have received authorization from BIS to do so. An authorization to submit declarations and reports electronically may be limited or withdrawn by BIS at any time. There are no prerequisites for obtaining permission to submit electronically, nor are there any limitations with regard to the types of declarations or reports that are eligible for electronic submission. However, BIS may direct, for any reason, that any electronic declaration or report be resubmitted in writing, either in whole or in part.",
            "(1) Requesting approval to submit declarations and reports electronically. To submit declarations and reports electronically, you or your company must submit a written request to BIS at the address identified in \u00a7 711.6 of the CWCR.

            "(A) If Web-DESI user account information (i.e., user name and password) is lost, stolen or otherwise compromised, the company and the user must report the loss, theft or compromise of the user account information, immediately, by calling BIS at (202) 482-1001. Within two business days of making the report, the company and the user must submit written confirmation to BIS at the address provided in \u00a7 711.6 of the CWCR.",
            "(B) Your company is responsible for immediately notifying BIS whenever a Web-DESI user leaves the employ of the company or otherwise ceases to be authorized by the company to submit declarations and reports electronically on its behalf.",
            "(v) No person may use, copy, appropriate or otherwise compromise a Web-DESI account user name or password assigned to another person. No person, except a person authorized access by the company, may use or copy the facility, plant site or trading company password (USC password), nor may any person steal or otherwise compromise this password.",
            "(c) Electronic submission of declarations and reports\u2014(1) General instructions.

These instructions may be modified by BIS from time to time.",
            "(2) Declarations and reports. The electronic submission of a declaration or report will constitute an official document as required under parts 712 through 715 of the CWCR. Such submissions must provide the same information as written declarations and reports and are subject to the recordkeeping provisions of part 720 of the CWCR. The company and Web-DESI user submitting the declaration or report will be deemed to have made all representations and certifications as if the submission were made in writing by the company and signed by the certifying official. Electronic submission of a declaration or report will be considered complete upon transmittal to BIS.",
            "(d) Updating. A company approved for electronic submission of declarations or reports under Web-DESI must promptly notify BIS of any change in its name, ownership or address. If your company wishes to have a person added as a Web-DESI user, your company must inform BIS and follow the instructions provided by BIS. Your company should conduct periodic reviews to ensure that the company's designated certifying official and Web-DESI users are persons whose current responsibilities make it necessary and appropriate that they act for the company in either capacity."

If you are required to complete forms pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, you must declare the aggregate quantity resulting from each type of activity (production, processing or consumption) from each plant on your plant site that exceeds the applicable threshold for that Schedule 2 chemical. Do not include in these aggregate production, processing, and consumption quantities any data from plants on the plant site that did not individually produce, process or consume a Schedule 2 chemical in amounts greater than the applicable threshold. For example, if a plant on your plant site produced a Schedule 2 chemical in an amount greater than the applicable declaration threshold during the previous calendar year, you would have to declare only the production quantity from that plant, provided that the total amount of the Schedule 2 chemical processed or consumed at the plant did not exceed the applicable declaration threshold during any one of the previous three calendar years. If in the previous calendar year your production, processing and consumption activities all were below the applicable declaration threshold, but your declaration requirement is triggered because of production activities occurring in an earlier year, you would declare \u201c0\u201d only for the declared production activities.",
            "(ii) Annual declaration on anticipated activities. If you are required to complete forms pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, you must declare the aggregate quantity of any Schedule 2 chemical that you plan to produce, process or consume at any plant(s) on your plant site above the applicable thresholds set forth in paragraphs (a)(1)(i)(A)(1) through (3) of this section during the next calendar year. Do not include in these anticipated aggregate production, processing, and consumption quantities any data from plants on the plant site that you do not anticipate will individually produce, process or consume a Schedule 2 chemical in amounts greater than the applicable thresholds.",

Prior to the development of a facility agreement, BIS shall notify the owner, operator, occupant, or agent in charge of the facility, and if the owner, operator, occupant or agent in charge so requests, the notified person may participate in preparations with BIS representatives for the negotiation of such an agreement. During the initial or routine inspection of a declared facility, the Inspection Team and the Host Team will negotiate a draft facility agreement or amendment to a facility agreement. To the maximum extent practicable consistent with the Convention, the owner and the operator, occupant or agent in charge of the facility may observe facility agreement negotiations between the U.S. Government and OPCW. As a general rule, BIS will consult with the affected facility on the contents of the agreements and take the facility's views into consideration during negotiations. BIS will participate in the negotiation of, and approve, all final facility agreements with the OPCW. Facilities will be notified of and have the right to observe final facility agreement negotiations between the United States and the OPCW to the maximum extent practicable, consistent with the Convention. Prior to the conclusion of a final facility agreement, the affected facility will have an opportunity to comment on the facility agreement. BIS will give consideration to such comments prior to approving final facility agreements with the OPCW. The USNA shall ensure that facility agreements for Schedule 1, Schedule 2, Schedule 3 and UDOC facilities are concluded, as appropriate, with the OPCW in coordination with BIS.",

            "(3) If subject to the EAR, what do the EAR require? Part 736 of the EAR lists all the prohibitions that are contained in the EAR. Note that certain prohibitions (General Prohibitions One through Three) apply to items as indicated on the CCL, and others (General Prohibitions Four through Ten) prohibit certain activities and apply to all items subject to the EAR unless otherwise indicated.",
            "(4) Do you need a license for your item or activity? What policies will BIS apply if you do need to submit license application? The EAR have four principal ways of describing license requirements:",
            "(i) The EAR may require a license to a country if your item is listed on the CCL and the Country Chart in part 738 of the EAR tells that a license is required to that country. Virtually all Export Control Classification Numbers (ECCN) on the CCL are covered by the Country Chart in part 738 of the EAR. That part identifies the limited number of entries that are not included on the Chart. These ECCNs will state the specific countries that require a license or refer you to a self-contained section, i.e., Short Supply in part 754 of the EAR, or Embargoes in part 746 of the EAR. If a license is required, you should consult part 740 of the EAR which describes the License Exception that may be available for items on the CCL. Part 742 of the EAR describes the licensing policies that BIS will apply in reviewing an application you file. Note that part 754 of the EAR on short supply controls and part 746 on embargoes are self-contained parts that include the available exceptions and licensing policy.",
            "(ii) A license requirement may be based on the end-use or end-user in a transaction, primarily for proliferation reasons. Part 744 of the EAR describes such requirements and relevant licensing policies and includes both restrictions on items and restrictions on the activities of U.S. persons.",
            "(iii) A license is required for virtually all exports to embargoed destinations, such as Cuba. Part 746 of the EAR describes all the licensing requirements, license review policies and License Exceptions that apply to such destinations. If your transaction involves one of these countries, you should first look at this part. This part also describes controls that may be maintained under the EAR to implement UN sanctions.",
            "(iv) In addition, under \u00a7\u00a7 736.2(b)(9) and (10) of the EAR, you may not engage in a transaction knowing a violation is about to occur or violate any orders, terms, and conditions under the EAR. Part 764 of the EAR describes prohibited transactions with a person denied export privileges or activity that violates the terms or conditions of a denial order.",
            "(5) How do you file a license application and what will happen to the application once you do file it? What if you need authorization for multiple transactions? Parts 748 and 750 of the EAR provide information on license submission and processing. If your application is denied, part 756 of the EAR provides rules for filing appeals.",
            "(6) How do you clear shipments with the U.S. Customs Service? Part 758 of the EAR describes the requirements for clearance of exports.",
            "(7) Where do you find the rules on restrictive trade practices and boycotts? Part 760 of the EAR deals with restrictive trade practices and boycotts.",
            "(8) Where are the rules on recordkeeping and enforcement? Part 762 of the EAR sets out your recordkeeping requirements, and parts 764 and 766 of the EAR deal with violations and enforcement proceedings.",
            "(9) What is the effect of foreign availability? Part 768 of the EAR provides rules for determining foreign availability of items subject to controls.",
            "(10) Do the EAR provide definitions and interpretations? Part 770 of the EAR contains interpretations and part 772 of the EAR lists definitions used.",
            "(b) Why the EAR are so detailed. Some people will find the great length of the EAR and their extensive use of technical terms intimidating. BIS believes, however, that such detail and precision can and does serve the interests of the public. The detailed listing of technical parameters in the CCL establishes precise, objective criteria. This should, in most cases, enable you to ascertain the appropriate control status. Broader, more subjective criteria would leave exporters and reexporters more dependent upon interpretations and rulings by BIS officials. Moreover, much of the detail in the CCL is derived from multilaterally adopted lists, and the specificity serves to enhance the uniformity and effectiveness of international control practices and to promote a \u201clevel playing field\u201d. The detailed presentation of such elements as licensing and export clearance procedures enables you to find in one place what you need to know to comply with pertinent requirements. Of special importance is the detailed listing of License Exception criteria, as these will enable you to determine quickly, and with confidence, that you may proceed with a transaction without delay. Finally, some of the detail results from the need to draft the EAR with care in order to avoid loop-holes and to permit effective enforcement.",
            "(c) Where to get help. Throughout the EAR you will find information on offices you can contact for various purposes and types of information. General information including assistance in understanding the EAR, information on how to obtain forms, electronic services, publications, and information on training programs offered by BIS, is available from the Office of Export Services at the following locations: Outreach and Educational Services Division, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th and Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Room H1099D, Washington, DC 20230, Tel: (202) 482-4811, Fax: (202) 482-2927, and Bureau of Industry and Security, Western Regional Office, U.S. Department of Commerce, 2302 Martin St., Suite 330, Irvine, CA 92612, Tel: (949) 660-0144, Fax: (949) 660-9347, and Bureau of Industry and Security, Western Regional Office, Northern California Branch, U.S. Department of Commerce, 160 W.

          "paragraphs": [
            "(a)(1) Introduction. In this part, references to the EAR are references to 15 CFR chapter VII, subchapter C. This part is intended to help you determine your obligations under the EAR by listing logical steps in \u00a7\u00a7 732.2 through 732.5 of this part that you can take in reviewing these regulations. A flow chart describing these steps is contained in supplement no. 1 to part 732. By cross-references to the relevant provisions of the EAR, this part describes the suggested steps for you to determine applicability of the following:",
            "(i) The scope of the EAR (part 734 of the EAR);",
            "(ii) Each of the general prohibitions (part 736 of the EAR);",
            "(iii) The License Exceptions (part 740 of the EAR); and",
            "(iv) Other requirements such as clearing your export with the U.S. Customs Service, keeping records, and completing and documenting license applications.",
            "(2) These steps describe the organization of the EAR, the relationship among the provisions of the EAR, and the appropriate order for you to consider the various provisions of the EAR.",
            "(3) The general information in this part is intended to provide an overview of the steps to be taken for certain requirements in the EAR, though not all of them. Nothing in this part shall be construed as altering or affecting any other authority, regulation, investigation or other enforcement measure provided by or established under any other provision of federal law, including provisions of the EAR.",
            "(b) Facts about your transaction. The following five types of facts determine your obligations under the EAR and will be of help to you in reviewing these steps:",
            "(1) What is it? What an item is, for export control purposes, depends on its classification, which is its place on the Commerce Control List (see part 774 of the EAR).",
            "(2) Where is it going? The country of ultimate destination for an export or reexport also determines licensing requirements (see parts 738 and 774 of the EAR concerning the Country Chart and the Commerce Control List).",
            "(3) Who will receive it? The ultimate end-user of your item cannot be a bad end-user. See General Prohibition Four (Denial Orders) in \u00a7 736.2(b)(4) and parts 744 and 764 of the EAR for a reference to the list of persons you may not deal with.",
            "(4) What will they do with it? The ultimate end-use of your item cannot be a bad end-use. See General Prohibition Five (End-Use End-User) in \u00a7 736.2(b)(5) and part 744 of the EAR for general end-use and end-user restrictions.",
            "(5) What else do they do? Conduct such as contracting, financing, and freight forwarding in support of a proliferation project (as described in \u00a7 744.6 of the EAR) may prevent you from dealing with someone.",
            "(c) Are your items and activities subject to the EAR? You should first determine whether your commodity, software, or technology is subject to the EAR (see part 734 of the EAR concerning scope), and Steps 1 through 6 help you do that. For exports from the United States, only Steps 1 and 2 are relevant. If you already know that your item or activity is subject to the EAR, you should go on to consider the ten general prohibitions in part 736 of the EAR. If your item or activity is not subject to the EAR, you have no obligations under the EAR and may skip the remaining steps.",
            "(d) Does your item or activity require a license under one or more of the ten general prohibitions?\u2014(1) Brief summary of the ten general prohibitions. The general prohibitions are found in part 736 of the EAR and referred to in these steps. They consist, very briefly, of the following:",
            "(i) General Prohibition One (Exports and Reexports): Export and reexport of controlled items to listed countries.",
            "(ii) General Prohibition Two (Parts and Components Reexports): Reexport and export from abroad of foreign-made items incorporating more than a de minimis amount of controlled U.S. content.",
            "(iii) General Prohibition Three (Foreign-produced Direct Product Reexports): Reexport and export from abroad of the foreign-produced direct product of U.S. technology and software.",
            "(iv) General Prohibition Four (Denial Orders): Engaging in actions prohibited by a denial order.",
            "(v) General Prohibition Five (End-Use End-User): Export or reexport to prohibited end uses or end users.",
            "(vi) General Prohibition Six (Embargo): Export or reexport to embargoed destinations.",
            "(vii) General Prohibition Seven (U.S. Person Proliferation Activity): Support of proliferation activities.",
            "(viii) General Prohibition Eight (In-Transit): In-transit shipments and items to be unladen from vessels and aircraft.",
            "(ix) General Prohibition Nine (Orders, Terms and Conditions): Violation of any orders, terms, or conditions.",
            "(x) General Prohibition Ten (Knowledge Violation to Occur): Proceeding with transactions with knowledge that a violation has occurred or is about to occur.",
            "(2) Controls on items on the Commerce Control List (CCL). If your item or activity is subject to the EAR, you should determine whether any one or more of the ten general prohibitions require a license for your export, reexport, or activity. Steps 7 through 11 refer to classification of your item on the Commerce Control List (CCL) (part 774 of the EAR) and how to use the Country Chart (supplement no. 1 to part 738 of the EAR) to determine whether a license is required based upon the classification of your item. These steps refer to General Prohibitions One (Exports and Reexports), Two (Parts and Components Reexports) , and Three (Foreign-Produced Direct Product Reexports) for all countries except: Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Syria. For these countries, you may skip Steps 7 through 11 and go directly to Step 12.",
            "(3) Controls on activities. Steps 12 through 18 refer to General Prohibitions Four through Ten. Those general prohibitions apply to all items subject to the EAR, not merely those items listed on the CCL in part 774 of the EAR. For example, they refer to the general prohibitions for persons denied export privileges, prohibited end-uses and end-users, countries subject to a comprehensive embargo (e.g., Cuba, Iran, North Korea and Syria), prohibited activities of U.S. persons in support of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, prohibited unlading of shipments, compliance with orders, terms and conditions, and activities when a violation has occurred or is about to occur.",
            "(4) General prohibitions. If none of the ten general prohibitions applies, you should skip the steps concerning License Exceptions and for exports from the United States, review Steps 27 through 29 concerning Shipper's Export Declarations to be filed with the U.S. Customs Service, Destination Control Statements for export control documents, and recordkeeping requirements.",
            "(e) Is a License Exception available to overcome the license requirement? If you decide by reviewing the CCL in combination with the Country Chart that a license is required for your destination, you should determine whether a License Exception will except you from that requirement. Steps 20 through 24 help you determine whether a License Exception is available. Note that generally License Exceptions are not available to overcome General Prohibitions Four through Ten. However, selected License Exceptions for embargoed destinations are specified in part 746 of the EAR and License Exceptions for short supply controls are specified in part 754 of the EAR. If a License Exception is available and the export is from the United States, you should review Steps 26 through 28 concerning Shipper's Export Declarations to be filed with the U.S. Customs Service, Destination Control Statements for export control documents and recordkeeping requirements. If a License Exception is not available, go on to Steps 25 through 29.",
            "(f) How do you apply for a license? If you must file a license application, you should review the requirements of part 748 of the EAR as suggested by Step 26. Then you should review Steps 27 through 29 concerning Shipper's Export Declarations to be filed with the U.S. Customs Service, Destination Control Statements for export control documents, and recordkeeping requirements."

            "(a) Step 1: Items subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of another Federal agency. This step is relevant for both exports and reexports. Determine whether your item is subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of another Federal Agency as provided in \u00a7 734.3 of the EAR.",
            "(1) If your item is subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of another Federal agency, comply with the regulations of that agency. You need not comply with the EAR and may skip the remaining steps.",
            "(2) If your item is not subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of another federal agency, then proceed to Step 2 in paragraph (b) of this section.",
            "(b) Step 2: Publicly available technology and software. This step is relevant for both exports and reexports. Determine if your technology or software is publicly available as defined and explained at part 734 of the EAR. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) website at https://www.bis.doc.gov contains several practical examples describing publicly available technology and software that are outside the scope of the EAR under the FAQ section of the website. See the FAQs under the heading, EAR Definitions, Technology and Software, Fundamental Research, and Patents FAQs at https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/documents/compliance-training/export-administrationregulations-training/1554-ear-definitions-faq/file. The examples are illustrative, not comprehensive. Note that encryption software classified under ECCN 5D002 on the Commerce Control List (refer to supplement no. 1 to part 774 of the EAR) is subject to the EAR even if publicly available, except for publicly available encryption object code software classified under ECCN 5D002 when the corresponding source code meets the criteria specified in \u00a7 740.13(e) of the EAR. The following also remains subject to the EAR: \u201cSoftware\u201d or \u201ctechnology\u201d for the production of a firearm, or firearm frame or receiver, controlled under ECCNs 0A501, 0A506, 0A507, or 0A509, as referenced in \u00a7 734.7(c) of the EAR.",
            "(1) If your technology or software is publicly available, and therefore outside the scope of the EAR, you may proceed with the export or reexport if you are not a U.S. person subject to General Prohibition Seven. If you are a U.S. person, go to Step 15 at \u00a7 732.3(j) of this part. If you are a U.S. person and General Prohibition Seven concerning proliferation activity of U.S. persons does not apply, then you may proceed with the export or reexport of your publicly available technology or software. Note that all U.S. persons are subject to the provisions of General Prohibition Seven.",
            "(2) If your technology or software is not publicly available and you are exporting from the United States, skip to the Step 7 in \u00a7 732.3(b) of this part concerning the general prohibitions.",
            "(3) If you are exporting items from a foreign country, you should then proceed to Step 3 in paragraph (c) of this section and the other steps concerning the scope of the EAR.",
            "(c) Step 3: Reexport of U.S.-origin items. This step is appropriate only for reexporters. For an item in a foreign country, you should determine whether the item is of U.S. origin. If it is of U.S.-origin, skip to Step 7 in \u00a7 732.3(b) of this part. If it is not of U.S. origin, then proceed to Step 4 in paragraph (d) of this section.",
            "(d) Step 4: Foreign-made items incorporating controlled U.S.-origin items. This step is appropriate only for items that are made outside the United States and not currently located in the United States. Special requirements and restrictions apply to foreign-made items that incorporate U.S.-origin encryption items (see \u00a7 734.4(a)(2), (b), and (g) of the EAR).",
            "(1) Determining whether your foreign made item is subject to the EAR. Using the guidance provided in supplement no. 2 to part 734 of the EAR, determine whether controlled U.S.-origin items are incorporated into the foreign-made item and are above the de minimis level set forth in \u00a7 734.4 of the EAR.",
            "(2) If no U.S.-origin controlled items are incorporated or if the percentage of incorporated U.S.-origin controlled items are equal to or below the de minimis level described in \u00a7 734.4 of the EAR, then the foreign-made item is not subject to the EAR by reason of the de minimis rules, and you should go on to consider Step 6 regarding the foreign-produced direct product rule.",
            "(3) If the foreign-made item incorporates more than the de minimis level of U.S.-origin items, then that item is subject to the EAR and you should skip to Step 7 at \u00a7 732.3 of this part and consider the steps regarding all other general prohibitions, license exceptions, and other requirements to determine applicability of these provisions to the foreign-made item.",
            "(e) [Reserved]",
            "(f) Step 6: Direct product rule. Foreign items that are the direct product of U.S. technology, software, or plant or major component of a plant made from U.S. technology or software may be subject to the EAR if they meet the conditions of General Prohibition Three in \u00a7 736.2(b)(3) of the EAR. Direct products that are subject to the EAR may require a license to be exported from abroad or reexported to certain countries.",
            "(1) Subject to the EAR. If your foreign item is captured by the direct product rule (General Prohibition Three), then the item is subject to the EAR and its export from abroad or reexport may require a license. You should next consider the steps regarding all other general prohibitions, license exceptions, and other requirements. If the item is not captured by General Prohibition Three, then you have completed the steps necessary to determine whether the item is subject to the EAR, and you may skip the remaining steps. As described in part 734 of the EAR, items outside the U.S. are subject to the EAR when they are:",
            "(i) U.S.-origin commodities, software, or technology, unless controlled for export exclusively by another U.S. Federal agency or unless publicly available;",
            "(ii) Foreign-origin commodities, software, or technology that are within the scope of General Prohibition Two (De minimis rules), or General Prohibition Three (Direct Product rule). However, such foreign-origin items are also outside the scope of the EAR if they are controlled for export exclusively by another U.S. Federal Agency or, if technology or software, are publicly available as described in paragraph (b) of this section.",

          "paragraphs": [
            "(a) Introduction. If your item or activity is subject to the scope of the EAR, you should then consider each of the ten general prohibitions listed in part 736 of the EAR. General Prohibitions One ((Exports and Reexports), Two (Parts and Components Reexports), and Three (Foreign-Produced Direct Product Reexports) (\u00a7 736.2(b) (1), (2), and (3) of the EAR) are product controls that are shaped and limited by parameters specified on the CCL and Country Chart. General Prohibitions Four through Ten are prohibitions on certain activities that are not allowed without authorization from BIS, and these prohibitions apply to all items subject to the EAR unless otherwise specified (\u00a7 736.2(b) (4) through (10) of the EAR).",
            "(b) Step 7: Classification. (1) You should classify your items \u201csubject to the EAR\u201d in the relevant entry on the CCL, and you may do so on your own without BIS assistance. The CCL includes a supplement no. 4 to part 774\u2014Commerce Control List Order of Review. This supplement establishes the steps (i.e., the order of review) that should be followed in classifying items that are \u201csubject to the EAR.\u201d The exporter, reexporter, or transferor is responsible for correctly classifying the items in a transaction, which may involve submitting a classification request to BIS. Failure to classify or have classified the item correctly does not relieve the person of the obligation to obtain a license when one is required by the EAR.",
            "(2) You have a right to request the applicable classification of your item from BIS, and BIS has a duty to provide that classification to you. For further information on how to obtain classification assistance from BIS, see part 748 of the EAR.",
            "(3) For items subject to the EAR but not listed on the CCL, the proper classification is EAR99. This number is a \u201cbasket\u201d for items not specified under any CCL entry and appears at the end of each Category on the CCL.",
            "(4) Items subject to temporary CCL controls are classified under the ECCN 0Y521 series (i.e., 0A521, 0B521, 0C521, 0D521 and 0E521) pursuant to \u00a7 742.6(a)(8) of the EAR while a determination is being made as to whether classification under a revised or new ECCN or EAR99 designation is appropriate.",
            "(c) Step 8: Country of ultimate destination. You should determine the country of ultimate destination. The country of destination determines the applicability of several general prohibitions, License Exceptions, and other requirements. Note that part 754 of the EAR concerning short supply controls is self-contained and is the only location in the EAR that contains both the prohibitions and exceptions applicable to short supply controls.",
            "(d) Step 9: Reason for control and the Country Chart\u2014(1) Reason for control and column identifier within the Export Control Classification Number (ECCN). Once you have determined that your item is controlled by a specific ECCN, you must use information contained in the \u201cLicense Requirements\u201d section of that ECCN in combination with the Country Chart to decide whether a license is required under General Prohibitions One, Two, or Three to a particular destination. The CCL and the Country Chart are taken together to define these license requirements. The applicable ECCN will indicate the reason or reasons for control for items within that ECCN. For example, ECCN 6A007 is controlled for national security, missile technology, and anti-terrorism reasons.",
            "(2) Reason for control within the Country Chart. With each of the applicable Country Chart column identifiers noted in the correct ECCN, turn to the Country Chart. Locate the correct Country Chart column identifier on the horizontal axis, and determine whether an \u201cX\u201d is marked in the cell next to the destination in question. Consult \u00a7 738.4 of the EAR for comprehensive instructions on using the Country Chart and a detailed example.",
            "(i) An \u201cX\u201d in the cell or cells for the relevant country and reason(s) for control column indicates that a license is required for General Prohibitions One (Exports and Reexports in the Form Received), Two (Parts and Components Reexports), and Three (Foreign-Produced Direct Product Reexports). (See \u00a7 736.2 (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) of the EAR).",
            "(ii) If one or more cells have an \u201cX\u201d in the relevant column, a license is required unless you qualify for a License Exception described in part 740 of the EAR. If a cell does not contain an \u201cX\u201d for your destination in one or more relevant columns, a license is not required under the CCL and the Country Chart.",
            "(iii) Additional controls may apply to your export. You must go on to steps 12 through 18 described in paragraphs (g) to (m) of this section to determine whether additional limits described in General Prohibition Two (Parts and Components Reexports) and General Prohibition Three (Foreign-Produced Direct Product Reexports) apply to your proposed transaction. If you are exporting an item from the United States, you should skip Step 10 and Step 11. Proceed directly to Step 12 in paragraph (g) of this section.",
            "(3) License requirements not on the Country Chart. There are two instances where the Country Chart cannot be used to determine if a license is required. Items controlled for short supply reasons are not governed by the Country Chart. Part 754 of the EAR contains license requirements and License Exceptions for items subject to short supply controls. A limited number of ECCNs contained on the CCL do not identify a Country Chart column identifier. In these instances, the ECCN states whether a license is required and for which destinations. See \u00a7 738.3(a) of the EAR for a list of the ECCNs for which you do not need to consult the Country Chart to determine licensing requirements.",
            "(4) Destinations subject to embargo and other special controls provisions. The Country Chart does not apply to Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Syria. For those countries you should review the provisions at part 746 of the EAR and may skip this step concerning the Country Chart. For Iraq and Russia, the Country Chart provides for certain license requirements, and part 746 of the EAR provides additional requirements.",
            "(5) Items subject to the EAR but not on the CCL. Items subject to the EAR that are not on the CCL are properly classified EAR99. For such items, you may skip this step and proceed directly with Step 12 in paragraph (g) of this section.",
            "(e) Step 10: Foreign-made items incorporating controlled U.S.-origin items and the de minimis rules\u2014(1) De minimis rules. If your foreign-made item abroad is a foreign-made commodity that incorporates controlled U.S.-origin commodities, a foreign-made commodity that is \u2018bundled\u2019 with controlled U.S.-origin software, foreign-made software that is commingled with controlled U.S.-origin software, or foreign-made technology that is commingled with controlled U.S.-origin technology, then it is subject to the EAR if the U.S.-origin controlled content exceeds the de minimis levels described in Sec. 734.4 of the EAR.",
            "(2) Guidance for calculations. For guidance on how to calculate the U.S.-controlled content, refer to supplement no. 2 to part 734 of the EAR. Note, U.S.-origin technology controlled by ECCN 9E003.a.1 through a.11, and .h, and related controls, and encryption software controlled for \u201cEI\u201d reasons under ECCN 5D002 (not eligible for de minimis treatment pursuant to \u00a7 734.4(b) of the EAR) or encryption technology controlled for \u201cEI\u201d reasons under ECCN 5E002 (not eligible for de minimis treatment pursuant to \u00a7 734.4(a)(2) of the EAR) do not lose their U.S.-origin when redrawn, used, consulted, or otherwise commingled abroad in any respect with other software or technology of any other origin. Therefore, any subsequent or similar software or technology prepared or engineered abroad for the design, construction, operation, or maintenance of any plant or equipment, or part thereof, which is based on or uses any such U.S.-origin software or technology is subject to the EAR.",
            "(f) Step 11: Foreign-produced direct product rule\u2014General Prohibition Three. Foreign-produced items located outside the U.S. that are the direct product of \u201ctechnology\u201d or \u201csoftware\u201d subject to the EAR or produced by a plant or major component of a plant located outside the United States that is a direct product of U.S.-origin \u201ctechnology\u201d or \u201csoftware\u201d subject to the EAR, whether made in the U.S. or a foreign country, may be subject to the EAR if they meet the conditions of General Prohibition Three in \u00a7 736.2(b)(3). Direct products that are subject to the EAR may require a license to be exported from abroad, transferred (in-country), or reexported to specified countries or end users. If your foreign item meets the conditions of the foreign-produced direct product rule (General Prohibition Three), then your export from abroad, transfer (in-country), or reexport is subject to the EAR. You should next consider the steps regarding all other general prohibitions, license exceptions, and other requirements. If your item does not meet the conditions of General Prohibition Three, then your export from abroad, transfer (in-country), or reexport is not subject to the EAR. You have completed the steps necessary to determine whether your transaction is subject to the EAR, and you may skip the remaining steps.",
            "(g) Step 12: Persons denied export privileges. (1) Determine whether your transferee, ultimate end-user, any intermediate consignee, or any other party to a transaction is a person denied export privileges (see part 764 of the EAR). It is a violation of the EAR to engage in any activity that violates the terms or conditions of a denial order. General Prohibition Four (Denial Orders) applies to all items subject to the EAR, i.e., both items on the CCL and within EAR99.",
            "(2) There are no License Exceptions to General Prohibition Four (Denial Orders). The prohibition concerning persons denied export privileges may be overcome only by a specific authorization from BIS, something that is rarely granted.",
            "(h) STEP 13: Prohibited end-uses and end-users. (1) Review the end-uses and end-users prohibited under General Prohibition Five (End-Use and End-User) (\u00a7 736.2(b)(5) of the EAR) described in part 744 of the EAR. Part 744 of the EAR contains all the end-use and end-user license requirements, and those are in addition to the license requirements under General Prohibitions One (Exports and Reexports), Two (Parts and Components Reexports), and Three (Foreign-produced Direct Product Reexports). Unless otherwise indicated, the license requirements of General Prohibition Five (End-Use and End-User) described in part 744 of the EAR apply to all items subject to the EAR, i.e. both items on the CCL and within EAR99. Moreover, the requirements of General Prohibition Five (End-Use and End-User) are in addition to various end-use and end-user limitations placed on certain License Exceptions.",
            "(2) Under License Exception TSU (\u00a7 740.13 of the EAR), operation technology and software, sales technology, and software updates overcome General Prohibition Five (End-Use and End-User) (\u00a7 736.2(b)(5) of the EAR) if all terms and conditions of these provisions are met by the exporter or reexporter.",
            "(i) Step 14: Embargoed countries and special destinations. If your destination for any item is Cuba, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, or Syria, you must consider the requirements of parts 742 and 746 of the EAR. Unless otherwise indicated, General Prohibition Six (Embargo) applies to all items subject to the EAR, i.e., both items on the CCL and within EAR99. See \u00a7 746.1(b) for destinations subject to limited sanctions under United Nations Security Council arms embargoes. See \u00a7\u00a7 746.5 for Russian and Belarusian industry sector sanctions, 746.6 for Crimea region of Ukraine and covered regions of Ukraine, 746.8 for Sanctions against Russia and Belarus, and 746.10 for 'luxury goods' sanctions against Russia and Belarus and Russian and Belarusian oligarchs and malign actors. You may not make an export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) contrary to the provisions of part 746 of the EAR without a license unless:",
            "(1) You are exporting, reexporting, or transferring only published information or software as specified in \u00a7 734.7 or other items outside the scope of the EAR, or",
            "(2) You qualify for a License Exception referenced in part 746 of the EAR concerning embargoed destinations. You may not use a license exception described in part 740 of the EAR to overcome General Prohibition Six (Embargo) (\u00a7 736.2(b)(6) of the EAR) unless it is specifically authorized in part 746 of the EAR. Note that part 754 of the EAR concerning short supply controls is self-contained and is the only location in the EAR for both the prohibitions and exceptions applicable to short supply controls.",
            "(j) Step 15: Restrictions on specific activities of \u201cU.S. persons.\u201d (1) Review the scope of activity prohibited by General Prohibition Seven (\u201cU.S. person\u201d activities) (\u00a7 736.2(b)(7) of the EAR) as that activity is described in \u00a7 744.6 of the EAR. Keep in mind that such activity is not limited to exports, reexports, or transfers (in-country). \u201cU.S. person\u201d activities extend to services and shipping or transmitting certain wholly foreign-origin items, or facilitating such shipments or transmissions, in 'support' of the specified weapons of mass destruction and military-intelligence-related end uses and end users and is not limited to items listed on the CCL or designated EAR99. See \u00a7 744.6(b)(6) of the EAR for the full definition of 'support,' which includes ordering, storing, using, selling, loaning, disposing, servicing, financing, transporting, freight forwarding, or conducting negotiations in furtherance of.",
            "(2) Review the definition of \u201cU.S. person\u201d in \u00a7 772.1 of the EAR.",
            "(k) Step 16: In-transit. Shippers and operators of vessels or aircraft should review General Prohibition Eight (In-Transit) to determine the countries in which you may not unladen or ship certain items in-transit. General Prohibition Eight applies to all items subject to the EAR, i.e. both items on the CCL and within EAR99.",
            "(l) Step 17: Review orders, terms, and conditions. Review the orders, terms, and conditions applicable to your transaction. General Prohibition Nine (Orders, Terms, and Conditions) prohibits the violation of any orders, terms, and conditions imposed under the EAR. Terms and conditions are frequently contained in licenses. In addition, the ten general prohibitions (part 736 of the EAR) and the License Exceptions (part 740 of the EAR) impose terms and conditions or limitations on your proposed transactions and use of License Exceptions. A given license or License Exception may not be used unless each relevant term or condition is met.",
            "(m) Step 18: Review the \u201cKnow Your Customer\u201d Guidance and General Prohibition Ten (Knowledge Violation to Occur). License requirements under the EAR are determined solely by the classification, end-use, end-user, ultimate destination, and conduct of U.S. persons. Supplement no. 1 to part 732 of the EAR is intended to provide helpful guidance regarding the process for the evaluation of information about customers, end-uses, and end-users. General Prohibition Ten (Knowledge Violation to Occur) prohibits anyone from proceeding with a transaction with knowledge that a violation of the EAR has occurred or is about to occur. It also prohibits related shipping, financing, and other services. General Prohibition Ten applies to all items subject to the EAR, i.e. both items on the CCL and within EAR99.",
            "(n) Step 19: Complete the review of the general prohibitions. After completion of Steps described in this section and review of all ten general prohibitions in part 736 of the EAR, including cross-referenced regulations in the EAR, you will know which, if any, of the ten general prohibitions of the EAR apply to you and your contemplated transaction or activity.",
            "(1) If none of the ten general prohibitions is applicable to your export from the United States, no license from BIS is required, you do not need to qualify for a License Exception under part 740 of the EAR. You should skip the Steps in \u00a7 732.4 of this part regarding License Exceptions and proceed directly to the Steps in \u00a7 732.5 of this part regarding recordkeeping, clearing the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection with the appropriate Shipper's Export Declaration or Automated Export System record, and using the required Destination Control Statement.",
            "(2) If none of the ten general prohibitions is applicable to your reexport or export from abroad, no license is required and you should skip all remaining Steps.",
            "(3) If one or more of the ten general prohibitions are applicable, continue with the remaining steps."

          "paragraphs": [
            "(a) Introduction to Steps for License Exceptions. If your export or reexport is subject to the EAR and is subject to General Prohibitions One (Exports and Reexports), Two (Parts and Components Reexports), or Three (Foreign-Produced Direct Product Reexports), consider the steps listed in paragraph (b) of this section. If your export or reexport is subject to General Prohibitions Four (Denial Orders), Seven (U.S. Person Proliferation Activity), Eight (In-Transit), Nine (Orders, Terms, and Conditions), or Ten (Knowledge Violation to Occur), there are no License Exceptions available for your export or reexport. If your export is subject to General Prohibition Five (End-Use End-User), consult part 744 of the EAR. If your export or reexport is subject to General Prohibition Six (Embargo), consult part 746 of the EAR for applicable License Exceptions.",
            "(b) Steps for License Exceptions\u2014(1) Step 20: Applicability of General Prohibitions. Determine whether any one or more of the general prohibitions described in \u00a7 736.2(b) of the EAR apply to your export or reexport. If no general prohibition applies to your export or reexport, then you may proceed with your export or reexport and need not review part 740 of the EAR regarding License Exceptions. You are reminded of your recordkeeping obligations related to the clearance of the U.S. Customs Service provided in parts 762 and 758 of the EAR.",
            "(2) Step 21: Applicability of restrictions on all License Exceptions. Determine whether any one or more of the restrictions in \u00a7 740.2 of the EAR applies to your export or reexport. If any one or more of these restrictions apply, there are no License Exceptions available to you, and you must either obtain a license or refrain from the export or reexport.",
            "(3) Step 22: Terms and conditions of the License Exceptions. (i) If none of the restrictions in \u00a7 740.2 of the EAR applies, then review each of the License Exceptions to determine whether any one of them authorizes your export or reexport. Eligibility for License Exceptions is based on the item, the country of ultimate destination, the end-use, and the end-user, along with any special conditions imposed within a specific License Exception.",
            "(ii) You may meet the conditions for more than one License Exception. Moreover, although you may not qualify for some License Exceptions you may qualify for others. Review the broadest License Exceptions first, and use any License Exception available to you. You are not required to use the most restrictive applicable License Exception. If you fail to qualify for the License Exception that you first consider, you may consider any other License Exception until you have determined that no License Exception is available.",
            "(iii) License Exceptions TMP, RPL, BAG, AVS, GOV, and TSU authorize exports notwithstanding the provisions of the CCL. List-based License Exceptions (LVS, GBS, CIV, TSR, and APP) are available only to the extent specified on the CCL. Part 740 of the EAR provides authorization for reexports only to the extent each License Exception expressly authorizes reexports. Some ECCNs contain License Exception STA exclusion paragraphs. Those paragraphs delineate items excluded from the License Exception STA provisions in \u00a7 740.20(c)(2) of the EAR. License Exception APR authorizes reexports only.",
            "(iv) If you are exporting under License Exceptions GBS, CIV, LVS, STA, APP, TSR or GOV, you should review \u00a7 743.1 of the EAR to determine the applicability of certain reporting requirements. If you are exporting under License Exceptions LVS, TMP, RPL, STA, or GOV and your item is classified in the \u201c600 series,\u201d you should review \u00a7 743.4 of the EAR to determine the applicability of certain reporting requirements for conventional arms exports.",
            "(4) Step 23: Scope of License Exceptions. Some License Exceptions are limited by country or by type of item.",
            "(i) Countries are arranged in country groups for ease of reference. For a listing of country groups, please refer to supplement no. 1 to part 740 of the EAR. Unless otherwise indicated in a License Exception, License Exceptions do not apply to any exports or reexports to embargoed destinations. If your export or reexport is subject to General Prohibition Six (Embargo) for embargoed destinations, License Exceptions are only available to the extent specifically provided in part 746 of the EAR concerning embargoed destinations.",
            "(ii) Special commodity controls apply to short supply items. No License Exceptions described in part 740 of the EAR may be used for items listed on the CCL as controlled for Short Supply reasons. License Exceptions for short supply items are found in part 754 of the EAR.",
            "(5) Step 24: Compliance with all terms and conditions. If a License Exception is available, you may proceed with your export or reexport. However, you must meet all the terms and conditions required by the License Exception that you determined authorized your export or reexport. You must also consult part 758 and 762 of the EAR to determine your recordkeeping and documentation requirements.",
            "(6) Step 25: License requirements. If no License Exception is available, then you must either obtain a license before proceeding with your export or reexport or you must refrain from the proposed export or reexport.",
            "(7) Step 26: License applications. (i) If you are going to file a license application with BIS, you should first review the requirements in part 748 of the EAR. Exporters, reexporters, and transferors should review the instructions concerning applications and required support documents prior to submitting an application for a license.",
            "(ii) If you are going to file a license application with BIS for the export, reexport, or in-country transfer for aircraft or military vessels controlled under ECCNs 0A606.a, 8A609.a, 8A620.a, 8A620.b, certain \u201cspacecraft\u201d controlled under ECCN subparagraphs 9A515.a.1, a.2, a.3, a.4 or 9A515.g, ECCN 9A610.a, or technology under ECCNs 9E515.b, .d, .e, or .f, \u00a7 740.20(g) permits you to request in the application that subsequent exports of the type of aircraft, spacecraft, military vessels, or technology at issue be eligible for export under License Exception STA.

            "(a) Step 27: Electronic Export Information (EEI) filing requirements. Exporters or agents authorized to file EEI to the Automated Export System (AES), should review \u00a7 758.1 of the EAR to determine when the EAR requires EEI to be filed and what EEI data elements the EAR requires to be included. More detailed information about EEI filing procedures and requirements may be found in the Bureau of Census Foreign Trade Regulations (FTR) at 15 CFR Part 30. Reexporters and firms exporting from abroad may skip Steps 27 through 29 and proceed directly to \u00a7 732.6 of the EAR.",
            "(1) License code/license exception code (license code). You must report the correct license code that corresponds with your license authority (license or license exception) or designation (No License Required (NLR)) for your export on the EEI filing, as appropriate. See \u00a7 758.1(g) of the EAR and 15 CFR 30.6(a)(23) and Part III of Appendix B to 15 CFR Part 30 of the FTR. Generally, conflicts of data elements with license exception criteria, e.g., ECCN or destination, will result in a fatal error in the AES system. By reporting a license code for a license exception on an EEI filing you are certifying that your transaction meets the criteria of that license exception. By reporting a license code of NLR you are certifying that no license is required for your export.",
            "(2) License number. If you are exporting under the authority of a license, you must report the license number on the EEI filing. See 15 CFR 30.6(b)(5) of the FTR.",
            "(3) Item description. You must report an item description identical to the item description on the license when a license is required, or report an item description sufficient in detail to permit review by the U.S. Government and verification of the Schedule B Number or the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) for license exception exports or exports for which No License is Required (NLR). See \u00a7 758.1(g) of the EAR; and 15 CFR 30.6(a)(13) of the FTR.",
            "(4) Entering the ECCN. You must report the correct Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) or \u201cEAR99\u201d for items that are not classified under an ECCN on the EEI filing for all licensed and license exception exports, and \u201cNo License Required\u201d (NLR) exports of items having a reason for control other than or in addition to anti-terrorism (AT). The only exception to this requirement would be the return of unwanted foreign origin items, meeting the provisions of License Exception TMP, under \u00a7 740.9(b)(3) of the EAR. See \u00a7 758.1(g) of the EAR and 15 CFR 30.6(b)(6) of the FTR.",

The Destination Control Statement (DCS) must be entered on the invoice and on the bill of lading, air waybill, or other export control document that accompanies the shipment from its point of origin in the United States to the ultimate consignee or end-user abroad. The person responsible for preparation of those documents is responsible for entry of the DCS. The DCS is required for all exports from the United States of items on the Commerce Control List and is not required for items classified as EAR99, unless the export may be made under License Exception BAG or GFT (see part 740 of the EAR). DCS requirements do not apply to reexports. See \u00a7 758.6 of the EAR.",

Publicly available technology and software not subject to the EAR are described in \u00a7\u00a7 734.7, 734.8, and 734.10. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) website at https://www.bis.doc.gov contains several practical examples describing publicly available technology and software that are outside the scope of the EAR under the FAQ section of the website. See the FAQs under the heading, EAR Definitions, Technology and Software, Fundamental Research, and Patents FAQs. The examples are illustrative, not comprehensive.",
            "(2) Items and activities subject to the EAR may also be controlled under export-related programs administered by other agencies. Items and activities subject to the EAR are not necessarily exempted from the control programs of other agencies. Although BIS and other agencies that maintain controls for national security and foreign policy reasons try to minimize overlapping jurisdiction, you should be aware that in some instances you may have to comply with more than one regulatory program.",
            "(3) The term \u201csubject to the EAR\u201d should not be confused with licensing or other requirements imposed in other parts of the EAR. Just because an item or activity is subject to the EAR does not mean that a license or other requirement automatically applies. A license or other requirement applies only in those cases where other parts of the EAR impose a licensing or other requirement on such items or activities.",

            "(4) General Prohibition Four (Denial Orders)\u2014Engaging in actions prohibited by a denial order. (i) You may not take any action that is prohibited by a denial order issued under part 766 of the EAR, Administrative Enforcement Proceedings. These orders prohibit many actions in addition to direct exports by the person denied export privileges, including some transfers within a single country, either in the United States or abroad, by other persons. You are responsible for ensuring that any of your transactions in which a person who is denied export privileges is involved do not violate the terms of the order. Orders denying export privileges are published in the Federal Register when they are issued and are the legally controlling documents in accordance with their terms. BIS also maintains compilations of persons denied export privileges on its Web site at http://www.bis.doc.gov. BIS may, on an exceptional basis, authorize activity otherwise prohibited by a denial order. See \u00a7 764.3(a)(2) of the EAR.",

You may not, without a license, knowingly export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) any item subject to the EAR to an end user or end use that is prohibited by part 744 of the EAR. Each section in part 744 specifies whether the license requirements extend to exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country).",
            "(6) General Prohibition Six\u2014Export, reexport, and transfer (in-country) to embargoed destinations (Embargo). (i) You may not, without a license or license exception or portion thereof that is specifically listed in the license exceptions paragraph pertaining to a particular sanctioned country or region in part 746 of the EAR, export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) any item subject to the EAR to a country or region (e.g., the Crimea region of Ukraine and covered regions of Ukraine) that is embargoed by the United States or otherwise made subject to controls under part 734 as both are described at part 746 of the EAR. Each section in part 746 specifies whether the license requirements extend to exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country).",
            "(ii) License exceptions to General Prohibition Six are described in part 746 of the EAR, on Embargoes and Other Special Controls. Unless a license exception or other authorization is authorized in part 746 of the EAR, the license exceptions described in part 740 of the EAR are not available to overcome this general prohibition.",
            "(7) General Prohibition Seven\u2014Support of proliferation activities and certain military-intelligence end uses and end users (\u201cU.S. person\u201d activities).\n\n (i) Support of proliferation activities and certain military-intelligence end uses and end users (\u201cU.S. person\u201d activities).",

            "(a) Commerce Control List scope. (1) In this part, references to the EAR are references to 15 CFR chapter VII, subchapter C. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) maintains the Commerce Control List (CCL) within the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), which includes items (i.e., commodities, software, and technology) subject to the export licensing authority of BIS. The CCL does not include those items exclusively controlled for export or reexport by another department or agency of the U.S. Government. In instances where agencies other than the Department of Commerce administer controls over related items, entries in the CCL contain a reference to these controls.",
            "(2) The CCL is contained in supplement no. 1 to part 774 of the EAR. Supplement no. 2 to part 774 of the EAR contains the General Technology and Software Notes relevant to entries contained in the CCL.",
            "(3) Items that warrant control for export or reexport but currently are not permanently classified on the CCL. Items subject to temporary CCL controls are classified under the ECCN 0Y521 series (i.e., 0A521, 0B521, 0C521, 0D521, and 0E521) pursuant to \u00a7 742.6(a)(8) of the EAR while a determination is made as to whether classification under a revised or new ECCN, or an EAR99 designation, is appropriate.",
            "(b) Commerce Country Chart scope. BIS also maintains the Commerce Country Chart. The Commerce Country Chart, located in supplement no. 1 to part 738, contains licensing requirements based on destination and Reason for Control. In combination with the CCL, the Commerce Country Chart allows you to determine whether a license is required for items on the CCL to any country in the world."

          "paragraphs": [
            "(a) Categories. The CCL is divided into 10 categories, numbered as follows:",
            "(b) Groups. Within each category, items are arranged by group. Each category contains the same five groups. Each Group is identified by the letters A through E, as follows:",
            "(c) Order of review. The CCL includes a supplement no. 4 to part 774\u2014Commerce Control List Order of Review. This supplement establishes the steps (i.e., the order of review) that should be followed in classifying items that are \u201csubject to the EAR.\u201d",
            "(d) Entries\u2014(1) Composition of an entry. Within each group, individual items are identified by an Export Control Classification Number (ECCN). Each number consists of a set of digits and a letter. The first digit identifies the general category within which the entry falls (e.g., 3A001). The letter immediately following this first digit identifies under which of the five groups the item is listed (e.g., 3A001). The second and third digits differentiate individual entries by identifying the type of controls associated with the items contained in the entry (e.g., 3A001). Table 1 lists the Reasons for Control associated with this second and third digits.",
            "(i) Reasons for Control are not mutually exclusive and numbers are assigned in order of precedence. As an example, if an item is controlled for both National Security and Missile Technology reasons, the entry's third alphanumeric character will be a \u201c0\u201d. If the item is controlled only for Missile Technology the third alphanumeric character will be \u201c1\u201d.",
            "(ii) The numbers in either the second or third digit (e.g., 3A001) serve to differentiate between multilateral, plurilateral, and unilateral entries. For example, an entry with the number \u201c99\u201d as the second and third digit, identifies the entire entry as controlled for a unilateral concern (e.g., 2B991 for anti-terrorism reasons). If the second digit is a \u201c2\u201d and the third digit is a \u201c9\u201d, the item is controlled for unilateral purposes based on a nuclear proliferation concern (e.g., 2A290 is controlled for unilateral purposes based on nuclear nonproliferation concerns).",
            "(iii) The last digit within each entry (e.g., 3A001) is used for the sequential numbering of ECCNs to differentiate between entries on the CCL.",
            "(iv) Last two characters in a \u201c600 series\u201d ECCN. The last two characters of each \u201c600 series\u201d ECCN generally track the Wassenaar Arrangement Munitions List (WAML) categories for the types of items at issue. The WAML ML21 (\u201csoftware\u201d) and ML22 (\u201ctechnology\u201d) are, however, included in D (\u201csoftware\u201d) and E (\u201ctechnology\u201d) CCL product groups to remain consistent with the structure of the CCL.",
            "(2) Reading an ECCN. An ECCN is made up of four sections, the \u201cHeading,\u201d \u201cLicense Requirements,\u201d \u201cLicense Exceptions,\u201d and \u201cList of Items Controlled\u201d sections. A brief description of each section and its use follows:",
            "(i) Heading. A description of the items controlled is provided next to each ECCN. In certain ECCNs, the description is a summary and will direct you to \u201csee List of Items Controlled\u201d for a complete list of items classified under those respective ECCNs. The \u201cItems\u201d paragraph in the List of Items Controlled section will describe all of the items that the ECCN controls for the portions of the heading that precede the \u201csee List of Items Controlled\u201d phrase. Portions of the heading that follow the phrase are complete descriptions of the items controlled by that portion of the heading. If \u201csee List of Items Controlled\u201d appears at the end of the heading, the \u201cItems\u201d paragraph in the List of Items Controlled section is the exclusive, complete list of the items the ECCN controls.",
            "(ii) License Requirements. This section contains a separate line identifying all possible Reasons for Control in order of precedence, and two columns entitled \u201cControl(s)\u201d and \u201cCountry Chart\u201d.",
            "(A) The \u201cControls\u201d header identifies all applicable Reasons for Control, in order of restrictiveness, and to what extent each applies (e.g., to the entire entry or only to certain subparagraphs). Those requiring licenses for a larger number of countries and/or items are listed first. As you read down the list the number of countries and/or items requiring a license declines. Since Reasons for Control are not mutually exclusive, items controlled within a particular ECCN may be controlled for more than one reason. The following is a list of all possible Reasons for Control:",
            "(B) The \u201cCountry Chart\u201d header identifies, for each applicable Reason for Control, a column name and number (e.g., CB Column 1). These column identifiers are used to direct you from the CCL to the appropriate column identifying the countries requiring a license. Consult part 742 of the EAR for an indepth discussion of the licensing requirements and policies applicable to each Country Chart column.",
            "(iii) License Exceptions. This section provides a brief eligibility statement for each ECCN-driven License Exception that may be applicable to your transaction, and should be consulted only AFTER you have determined a license is required based on an analysis of the entry and the Country Chart. The brief eligibility statement in this section is provided to assist you in deciding which ECCN-driven License Exception related to your particular item and destination you should explore prior to submitting an application. The term \u201cYes\u201d (followed in some instances by the scope of Yes) appears next to each available ECCN-driven License Exception. Some ECCNs have License Exception STA exclusion paragraphs. These paragraphs identify items for which the License Exception STA provisions in \u00a7 740.20(c)(2) of the EAR may not be used, but do not otherwise affect License Exception STA availability. The term \u201cN/A\u201d will be noted for License Exceptions that are not available within a particular entry. In some \u201c600 series\u201d ECCNs, the STA license exception paragraph or a note to the License Exceptions section contains additional information on the availability of License Exception STA for that ECCN. If one or more License Exceptions appear to apply to your transaction, you must consult part 740 of the EAR to review the conditions and restrictions applicable to each available License Exception. The list of License Exceptions contained within each ECCN is not an all-exclusive list. Other License Exceptions, not based on particular ECCNs, may be available. Consult part 740 of the EAR to determine eligibility for non-ECCN-driven License Exceptions.",
            "(iv) List of Items Controlled\u2014(A) Related definitions. This header identifies, where appropriate, definitions or parameters that apply to all items controlled by the entry. The information provided in this section is unique to the entry, and hence not listed in the definitions contained in part 772 of the EAR.",
            "(B) Related controls. If another U.S. government agency or department has export licensing authority over items related to those controlled by an entry, a statement is included identifying the agency or department along with the applicable regulatory cite. An additional cross-reference may be included in instances where the scope of controls differs between a CCL entry and its corresponding entry on list maintained by the European Union. This information is provided to assist readers who use both lists.",
            "(C) Items. This paragraph describes the relationship between the \u201citems\u201d paragraph and ECCN headings and will assist your understanding as you classify items on the CCL. When the heading contains the phrase \u201csee List of Items Controlled,\u201d the portion of the heading preceding that phrase is only a summary of the items controlled by the ECCN and the \u201citems\u201d paragraph contains an exclusive list of items described in the heading. Paragraphs (d)(2)(iv)(C)(1), (2) and (3) of this section provide examples of the three different uses of the phrase \u201c(see List of Items Controlled)\u201d in ECCN headings. Each heading on the CCL uses one of these three structures. Understanding the relationship between the heading and the \u201citems\u201d paragraph is important when classifying items that are \u201csubject to the EAR\u201d on the CCL.",
            "(1) \u201c(See List of Items Controlled)\u201d is at the end of the ECCN heading. An example of an ECCN where all of the heading text precedes the phrase \u201c(see List of Items Controlled)\u201d is ECCN 8A002 Marine systems, equipment, \u201cparts\u201d and \u201ccomponents,\u201d as follows (see List of Items Controlled). ECCNs 1A001, 3A001, 6A001, 7A004 and 9A012 are other examples where all of the heading text precedes the phrase \u201c(see List of Items Controlled).\u201d In these types of headings, the items paragraphs must be reviewed to determine whether your item is contained within the heading and classified under that ECCN.",
            "(2) \u201c(See List of Items Controlled)\u201d is in the middle of the ECCN heading. If the phrase \u201c(see List of Items Controlled)\u201d appears in the middle of the ECCN heading, then all portions of the heading that follow the phrase \u201c(see List of Items Controlled)\u201d will list items controlled in addition to the list in the \u201citems\u201d paragraph. An example of such a heading is ECCN 2B992 Non-\u201cnumerically controlled\u201d machine tools for generating optical quality surfaces, (see List of Items Controlled) and \u201cspecially designed\u201d \u201cparts\u201d and \u201ccomponents\u201d therefor. Under the ECCN 2B992 example, the \u201citems\u201d paragraph must be reviewed to determine whether your item is contained within the first part of the heading (\u201cnon-'numerically controlled' machine tools for generating optical quality surfaces\u201d) and classified under 2B992. The second part of the ECCN 2B992 heading (\u201cand 'specially designed' 'parts' and 'components' therefor\u201d) contains the exclusive list described in the heading. ECCNs 1A006, 3B992, 4A001, 6A006 and 7A001 are other examples where the phrase \u201c(see List of Items Controlled)\u201d appears in the middle of the ECCN heading.",
            "(3) ECCNs that do not use the phrase \u201c(see List of Items controlled).\u201d When all items classified in the ECCN are listed in the heading, a sentence is generally included in the \u201citems\u201d paragraph to direct you to the heading. An example of such a heading is ECCN 4E980 \u201cTechnology\u201d for the \u201cdevelopment,\u201d \u201cproduction\u201d or \u201cuse\u201d of commodities controlled by 4A980. ECCNs 0A982, 5D101, 8D001 and 9A002 are other examples where the heading is the exclusive description of the items classified under those respective ECCNs."

            "(a) Scope. The Commerce Country Chart allows you to determine the Commerce Control List (CCL) export and reexport license requirements for most items listed on the CCL. Such license requirements are based on the Reasons for Control listed in the Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) that applies to the item. Some ECCNs, however, impose license requirements either without reference to a reason for control code that is listed on the Commerce Country Chart, or in addition to such a reference. Those ECCNs may state their license requirements in full in their \u201cReasons for Control\u201d sections or they may refer the reader to another provision of the EAR for license requirement information.

There are a number of destinations that are not listed in the Country Chart contained in supplement no. 1 to part 738. If your destination is not listed on the Country Chart and such destination is a territory, possession, dependency or department of a country included on the Country Chart, the EAR accords your destination the same licensing treatment as the country of which it is a territory, possession, dependency or department. For example, if your destination is the Cayman Islands, a dependent territory of the United Kingdom, refer to the United Kingdom on the Country Chart for licensing requirements. In addition, if your destination is Liechtenstein, which serves as one territory with Switzerland for purposes of the EAR, refer to Switzerland on the Country Chart for licensing requirements.",
            "(c) Columns. Stretching out to the right are horizontal headers identifying the various Reasons for Control. Under each Reason for Control header are diagonal column identifiers capping individual columns. Each column identifier consists of the two letter Reason for Control and a column number. (e.g., CB Column 1). The column identifiers correspond to those listed in the \u201cCountry Chart\u201d header within the \u201cLicense Requirements\u201d section of each ECCN.",
            "(d) Cells. The symbol \u201cX\u201d is used to denote licensing requirements on the Country Chart. If an \u201cX\u201d appears in a particular cell, transactions subject to that particular Reason for Control/Destination combination require a license. There is a direct correlation between the number of \u201cX\u201ds applicable to your transaction and the number of licensing reviews your application will undergo."

            "(a) Using the CCL and the Country Chart\u2014(1) Overview. Once you have determined that your item is classified under a specific ECCN, you must use information contained in the \u201cLicense Requirements\u201d section of that ECCN in combination with the Country Chart to decide whether a license is required. Note that not all license requirements set forth under the \u201cLicense Requirements\u201d section of an ECCN refer you to the Commerce Country Chart, but in some cases this section will contain references to a specific section in the EAR for license requirements. In such cases, this section would not apply.",
            "(2) License decision making process. The following decision making process must be followed in order to determine whether a license is required to export or reexport a particular item to a specific destination:",
            "(i) Examine the appropriate ECCN in the CCL. Is the item you intend to export or reexport controlled for a single Reason for Control?",
            "(A) If yes, identify the single Reason for Control and the relevant Country Chart column identifier (e.g., CB Column 1).",
            "(B) If no, identify the Country Chart column identifier for each applicable Reason for Control (e.g., NS Column 1, NP Column 1, etc.).",
            "(ii) Review the Country Chart. With each of the applicable Country Chart Column identifiers noted, turn to the Country Chart (supplement no. 1 to part 738). Locate the correct Country Chart column identifier on the diagonal headings, and determine whether an \u201cX\u201d is marked in the cell next to the country in question for each Country Chart column identified in the applicable ECCN. If your item is subject to more than one reason for control, repeat this step using each unique Country Chart column identifier.",
            "(A) If yes, a license application must be submitted based on the particular reason for control and destination, unless a License Exception applies. If \u201cYes\u201d is noted next to any of the listed License Exceptions, you should consult part 740 of the EAR to determine whether you can use any of the available ECCN-driven License Exceptions to effect your shipment, rather than applying for a license. Each affirmative license requirement must be overcome by a License Exception. If you are unable to qualify for a License Exception based on each license requirement noted on the Country Chart, you must apply for a license. Note that other License Exceptions, not related to the CCL, may also apply to your transaction (See part 740 of the EAR).",
            "(B) If no, a license is not required based on the particular Reason for Control and destination. Provided that General Prohibitions Four through Ten do not apply to your proposed transaction and the License Requirement section does not refer you to any other part of the EAR to determine license requirements. For example, any applicable encryption classification requirements described in \u00a7 740.17(b) of the EAR must be met for certain mass market encryption items to affect your shipment using the symbol \u201cNLR.\u201d Proceed to parts 758 and 762 of the EAR for information on export clearance procedures and recordkeeping requirements. Note that although you may stop after determining a license is required based on the first Reason for Control, it is best to work through each applicable Reason for Control. A full analysis of every possible licensing requirement based on each applicable Reason for Control is required to determine the most advantageous License Exception available for your particular transaction and, if a license is required, ascertain the scope of review conducted by BIS on your license application.",
            "(b) Sample analysis using the CCL and Country Chart\u2014(1) Scope. The following sample entry and related analysis is provided to illustrate the type of thought process you must complete in order to determine whether a license is required to export or reexport a particular item to a specific destination using the CCL in combination with the Country Chart.",
            "(2) Sample CCL entry.",
            "(3) Sample analysis. After consulting the CCL, I determine my item, valued at $10,000, is classified under ECCN 2A000.a. I read that the entire entry is controlled for national security, and anti-terrorism reasons. Because my item is classified under paragraph .a, and not .b, I understand that though nuclear nonproliferation controls apply to a portion of the entry, they do not apply to my item. I note that the appropriate Country Chart column identifiers are NS Column 2 and AT Column 1. Turning to the Country Chart, I locate my specific destination, Chad, and see that an \u201cX\u201d appears in the NS Column 2 cell for Chad, but not in the AT Column 1 cell. I understand that a license is required, unless my transaction qualifies for a License Exception. From the License Exception LVS value listed in the entry, I know immediately that my proposed transaction exceeds the value limitation associated with LVS. Noting that License Exception GBS is \u201cYes\u201d for this entry, I turn to part 740 of the EAR to review the provisions related to use of GBS."

A \u201cLicense Exception\u201d is an authorization contained in this part that allows you to export or reexport under stated conditions, items subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) that would otherwise require a license under General Prohibition One, Two, Three, or Eight, as indicated under one or more of the Export Control Classification Numbers (ECCNs) in the Commerce Control List (CCL) in supplement no. 1 to part 774 of the EAR and items subject to the EAR that would require a license based on the embargo policies described in part 746 of the EAR. If your export or reexport is subject to General Prohibition Six for embargoed destinations, refer to part 746 of the EAR to determine the availability of any License Exceptions. Special commodity controls apply to short supply items. License Exceptions for items listed on the CCL as controlled for Short Supply reasons are found in part 754 of the EAR. If your export or reexport is subject to General Prohibition Five, consult part 744 of the EAR. If your export or reexport is subject to General Prohibitions Four, Seven, Nine, or Ten, then no License Exceptions apply. Any license exception authorizing reexports also authorizes in-country transfers, provided the terms and conditions for reexports under that license exception are met.",
            "(b) Certification. By using any of the License Exceptions you are certifying that the terms, provisions, and conditions for the use of the License Exception described in the EAR have been met. Please refer to part 758 of the EAR for clearance of shipments and documenting the use of License Exceptions.",

Items temporarily in the United States meeting the provisions of License Exception TMP, under \u00a7 740.9(b)(3), are excepted from this requirement. See \u00a7 758.1 of the EAR and 15 CFR part 30 of the FTR for EEI requirements.",

            "(c) Definitions\u2014(1) Order. The term order as used in this \u00a7 740.3 means a communication from a person in a foreign country, or that person's representative, expressing an intent to import commodities from the exporter. Although all of the details of the order need not be finally determined at the time of export, terms relating to the kinds and quantities of the commodities to be exported, as well as the selling prices of these commodities, must be finalized before the goods can be exported under License Exception LVS.",

The actual selling price of the commodities that are included in the same order and are controlled under the same entry on the CCL, less shipping charges, or the current market price of the commodities to the same type of purchaser in the United States, whichever is the larger. In determining the actual selling price or the current market price of the commodity, the value of containers in which the commodity is being exported may be excluded. The value for LVS purposes is that of the controlled commodity that is being exported, and may not be reduced by subtracting the value of any content that would not, if shipped separately, be subject to licensing. Where the total value of the containers and their contents must be shown on Shipper's Export Declarations under one Schedule B Number, the exporter, in effecting a shipment under this License Exception, must indicate the \u201cnet value\u201d of the contained commodity immediately below the description of the commodity.",

An order is eligible for shipment under LVS when the \u201cnet value\u201d of the commodities controlled under the same entry on the CCL does not exceed the amount specified in the \u201cLVS\u201d paragraph for that entry. An LVS shipment may include more than one eligible order.",
            "(ii) Orders may not be split to meet the applicable LVS dollar limits. An order that exceeds the applicable LVS dollar value limit may not be misrepresented as two or more orders, or split among two or more shipments, to give the appearance of meeting the applicable LVS dollar value limit. However an order that meets all the LVS eligibility requirements, including the applicable LVS dollar value limit, may be split among two or more shipments.",

The total value of exports per calendar year to the same ultimate or intermediate consignee of commodities classified under a single ECCN may not exceed 12 times the LVS value limit for that ECCN; however, there is no restriction on the number of shipments provided that value is not exceeded. This annual value limit applies to shipments to the same ultimate consignee even though the shipments are made through more than one intermediate consignee. There is no restriction on the number of orders that may be included in a shipment, except that the annual value limit per ECCN must not be exceeded.",
            "(3) Orders where two or more LVS dollar value limits apply. An order may include commodities that are controlled under more than one entry on the CCL. In this case, the net value of the entire order may exceed the LVS dollar value for any single entry on the CCL. However, the net value of the commodities controlled under each ECCN entry shall not exceed the LVS dollar value limit specified for that entry.",

Such U.S.-owned or controlled foreign firms require a specific license from BIS as well as the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). Transactions not subject to the EAR (under 25% U.S.-origin content) require a license from OFAC.",
            "(c) Prior notification\u2014(1) General requirement. You must notify BIS prior to any export or reexport (or prior to the first of multiple shipments) under License Exception AGR.",
            "(2) Procedures. You must provide prior notification of exports and reexports under License Exception AGR by submitting a completed application in accordance with \u00a7 748.1 of the EAR. The following blocks must be completed, as appropriate: Blocks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (by marking box 5 \u201cOther\u201d), 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22 (a), (e), (f), (g), (h), (i), (j), 23, and 25 according to the instructions described in supplement no. 1 to part 748 of the EAR. If your commodity is fertilizer, western red cedar or live horses, you must confirm that BIS has previously classified your commodity as EAR99 by placing the Commodity Classification Automatic Tracking System (CCATS) number in Block 22(d). BIS will not initiate the registration of an AGR notification unless the application is complete.",
            "(3) Action by BIS. Within two business days of the registration of the AGR notification, BIS will refer the notification for interagency review, or if necessary return the notification without action (e.g., if the information provided is incomplete). Registration is defined as the point at which the notification is entered into BIS's electronic system.",
            "(4) Review by other departments or agencies. The Departments of Defense, State, and other agencies, as appropriate, may review the AGR notification. BIS must receive department or agency objections within nine business days of the referral. Unlike the provisions described in \u00a7 750.4(b) of the EAR, there are no provisions for stopping the processing time of the AGR notification. If, within 11 business days after the date of registration, any reviewing agency provides a written objection that the recipient may promote international terrorism or the transaction raises nonproliferation concerns, you may not use License Exception AGR. In such cases, BIS will notify you that a license is required for the export or reexport. BIS will then process the AGR notification as a license application in accordance with the provisions described in \u00a7 750.4 of the EAR, and the licensing policies set forth in the EAR. At this time, BIS may request additional information. When BIS confirms that no agency has raised an objection within eleven business days (as described in paragraph (c)(5) of this section), you may proceed with the transaction provided that you satisfy all other requirements of License Exception AGR, including the requirement to have a written contract prior to any shipment (unless a donation or commercial sample). (Note that the fact that you have been advised that no agency has objected to the transaction does not exempt you from other licensing requirements under the EAR, such as those based on knowledge of a prohibited end-use or end-user as referenced in general prohibition five (part 736 of the EAR) and set forth in part 744 of the EAR.)",
            "(5) Status of pending AGR notification requests. You must contact BIS's System for Tracking Export License Applications (STELA) (https://snapr.bis.doc.gov/stela) for status of your pending AGR notification or verify the status in BIS's Simplified Network Applications Processing Redesign (SNAP-R) System. STELA will provide the date of registration of the AGR notification. If no department or agency objection is raised within 11 business days, STELA will, on the twelfth business day following the date of registration, provide you with confirmation of that fact. You may not proceed with your shipment unless you confirm with either STELA or SNAP-R that no objection has been raised. If an objection is raised, STELA and SNAP-R will indicate that a license is required. The AGR notification will then be processed as a license application. In addition, BIS may provide notice of an objection by telephone, fax, courier service, or other means.",
            "(d) Donations. (1) Donations of agricultural commodities are eligible for export and reexport to Cuba under License Exception AGR, provided the transaction meets the requirements and procedures of this license exception (except the written contract requirement).",
            "(2) Donations of food items to non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and individuals in Cuba may also be eligible for License Exception GFT. See \u00a7 740.12 for eligibility requirements of gift parcels and humanitarian donations under License Exception GFT."

Requests for License Exception STA eligibility must be made via the BIS Simplified Network Application Process-Redesign(SNAP-R) system unless BIS authorizes submission via the paper BIS-748-P Multipurpose Application form. For situations in which BIS 748-P submissions may be authorized, see \u00a7 748.1(d)(1).

The Departments of Commerce, Defense and State will review License Exception STA eligibility requests in accordance with the timelines set forth in Executive Order 12981 and \u00a7 750.4. If the License Exception STA request is approved, the process outlined in paragraph (g)(5)(i) of this section is followed.",
            "(4) Review criteria. The Departments of Commerce, Defense and State will determine whether the \u201cend item\u201d is eligible for this license exception based on an assessment of whether it provides a critical military or intelligence advantage to the United States or is otherwise available in countries that are not regime partners or close allies. If the \u201cend item\u201d does not provide a critical military or intelligence advantage to the United States or is otherwise available in countries that are not regime partners or close allies, the Departments will determine that License Exception STA is available unless an overarching foreign policy rationale for restricting STA availability can be articulated. Consensus among the Departments is required in order for an \u201cend item\u201d to be eligible for License Exception STA. Such determinations are made by the departments' representatives to the Advisory Committee on Export Policy (ACEP), or their designees.",
            "(5) Disposition of License Exception STA eligibility requests\u2014(i) Approvals. If the request for STA eligibility is approved, the applicant will receive notification from BIS authorizing the use of the additional License Exception STA for the specific end items requested. This will be in the form of a notice generated by SNAP-R to the applicant. Applicants who receive an approval notification may share it with companies affiliated with them, such as a branch or distributor, and may also take steps to make it public (e.g., on their Web site) if the applicants so wish. In addition, BIS will add a description of the approved end item in the relevant ECCN and in an online table posted on the BIS Web site, which removes the restriction on the use of License Exception STA for the end item identified in the approved request. BIS will publish, as needed, a final rule adding this license exception eligibility to the EAR for that ECCN entry or end item.",
            "(ii) Denials. If the STA eligibility request is not approved, the applicant will receive written notification from BIS. This will be in the form of a notice generated by SNAP-R to the applicant. Applicants may re-submit STA eligibility requests at any time."

These ECCNs are: 0A980 (Horses for export by sea); 1C980 (certain inorganic chemicals); 1C982 (certain other petroleum products); 1C983 (certain natural gas liquids and other natural gas derivatives); 1C984 (certain manufactured gas and synthetic natural gas (except when commingled with natural gas and thus subject to export authorization from the Department of Energy); and 1C988 (Unprocessed western red cedar (thuja plicata) logs and timber, and rough, dressed and worked lumber containing wane).",
            "(2) U.N. Sanctions. The United Nations imposes sanctions, short of complete embargoes, against certain countries which may result in controls that supplement those otherwise maintained under the EAR for that particular country. This part does not address license requirements and licensing policies for controls implementing U.N. sanctions. CCL entries containing items subject to U.N. sanctions will refer the exporter to part 746 of the EAR, Embargoes and Other Special Controls, for any supplemental controls that may apply to exports and reexports involving these countries.",
            "(c) Exports and reexports involving Cuba and Iran. This part does not cover license requirements and licensing policies that apply to exports and reexports to embargoed destinations (Cuba and Iran). These comprehensive embargoes cover a broader range of items than those reflected in the CCL. If you are exporting or reexporting to any of these destinations, you should first review part 746 of the EAR, Embargoes and Other Special Controls.",
            "(d) Anti-terrorism Controls on Iran, North Korea, and Syria. Commerce maintains anti-terrorism controls on Iran, North Korea, and Syria under section 6(a) of the Export Administration Act. Items controlled under section 6(a) to Iran, Syria, and North Korea are described in \u00a7\u00a7 742.8, 742.9, 742.10, and 742.19, respectively, and in Supplement No. 2 to part 742. Commerce also maintains controls under section 6(j) of the EAA to Iran, North Korea, and Syria. Items controlled to these countries under EAA section 6(j) are also described in Supplement 2 to part 742. The Secretaries of Commerce and State are required to notify appropriate Committees of the Congress 30 days before issuing a license for an item controlled under section 6(j) to North Korea, Iran, or Syria. If you are exporting or reexporting to Iran, North Korea, or Syria, you should review part 746 of the EAR, Embargoes and Other Special Controls.",
            "(e) End-user and end-use based controls. This part does not cover prohibitions and licensing requirements for exports of items not included on the CCL that are subject to end-use and end-user controls: certain nuclear end-uses; certain missile end-uses; certain chemical and biological weapons end-uses; certain naval nuclear propulsion end-uses; certain activities of U.S. persons; and certain exports to and for the use of certain foreign vessels and aircraft. Licensing requirements and policies for these exports are contained in part 744 of the EAR.",
            "(f) Overlapping license policies. Many items on the CCL are subject to more than one type of control (e.g., national security (NS), missile technology (MT), nuclear nonproliferation (NP), regional stability (RS)). In addition, applications for all items on the CCL, other than those controlled for short supply reasons, may be reviewed for missile technology (see \u00a7 742.5(b)(3) of this part), nuclear nonproliferation (see \u00a7 742.3(b)(2) of this part), or chemical and biological weapons (see \u00a7 742.2(b)(3) of this part), if the end-use or end-user may be involved in certain proliferation activities. Finally, many multilaterally controlled items are reviewed for anti-terrorism reasons if they are destined for a terrorism-supporting country (see paragraph (d) of this section). Your application for a license will be reviewed under all applicable licensing policies. A license will be issued only if an application can be approved under all applicable licensing policies."

            "(ii) 0Y521 Items. Items subject to the EAR that are not listed elsewhere in the CCL, but which the Department of Commerce, with the concurrence of the Departments of Defense and State, has determined should be controlled for export because the items provide at least a significant military or intelligence advantage to the United States or for foreign policy reasons are classified under ECCNs 0A521, 0B521, 0C521, 0D521 and 0E521. These items are typically emerging technologies (including emerging commodities, software and technology) that are not yet included in the CCL, so such items are listed on the CCL in 0Y521 ECCNs while the U.S. Government determines whether classification under a revised or new ECCN, or an EAR 99 designation, is appropriate.

BIS may extend an item's ECCN 0Y521 classification for two one-year periods, provided that the U.S. Government has submitted a proposal to the relevant multilateral regime(s) to obtain multilateral controls over the item. Further extension beyond three years may occur only if the Under Secretary for Industry and Security makes a determination that such extension is in the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States. Any extension or re-extension of control of an ECCN 0Y521 item, including the determination by the Under Secretary, shall be published in the Federal Register.",

The United States has a critical interest in ensuring that important and sensitive information of the public and private sector is protected. Consistent with our international obligations as a member of the Wassenaar Arrangement, the United States has a responsibility to maintain control over the export and reexport of encryption items. As the President indicated in Executive Order 13026 and in his Memorandum of November 15, 1996, exports and reexports of encryption software, like exports and reexports of encryption hardware, are controlled because of this functional capacity to encrypt information, and not because of any informational or theoretical value that such software may reflect, contain, or represent, or that its export or reexport may convey to others abroad.

            "(a)(1) Introduction. In this part, references to the EAR are references to 15 CFR chapter VII, subchapter C. This part contains prohibitions against exports, reexports, and selected transfers to certain end users and end uses as introduced under General Prohibitions Five (End use/End users) and Nine (Orders, Terms, and Conditions), unless authorized by BIS. Sections 744.2, 744.3, and 744.4 prohibit exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) of items subject to the EAR to defined nuclear, missile, and chemical and biological weapons proliferation activities. Section 744.5 prohibits exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) of items subject to the EAR to defined nuclear maritime end-uses. Consistent with General Prohibition Seven (Support of Proliferation Activities and certain Military-Intelligence End Uses and End Users (\u201cU.S. person\u201d activities)), \u00a7 744.6 prohibits specific activities by U.S. persons in support of certain nuclear, missile, chemical and biological weapons end uses, and whole plants for chemical weapons precursors, as well as certain military-intelligence end uses and military-intelligence end users. Section 744.7 prohibits exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) of certain items for certain aircraft and vessels. Section 744.8 prohibits exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) without authorization when a person designated on the list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN List) pursuant to certain specified sanctions programs is a party to the transaction. Section 744.9 sets forth restrictions on exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) of certain cameras, systems, or related components. Section 744.11 imposes license requirements, to the extent specified in supplement no. 4 to this part, on entities listed in supplement no. 4 to this part for activities contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States. Section 744.15 sets forth the conditions for exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) to persons listed on the Unverified List (UVL) in supplement no. 6 to this part, the criteria for revising the UVL, as well as procedures for requesting removal or modification of a listing on the UVL. Section 744.16 sets forth the license requirements, policies and procedures for the Entity List. Section 744.17 sets forth restrictions on exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) of microprocessors and associated \u201csoftware\u201d and \u201ctechnology\u201d for military end uses and to military end users. Section 744.19 sets forth BIS's licensing policy for applications for export, reexport, and transfer (in-country) when a party to the transaction is an entity that has been sanctioned pursuant to any of three specified statutes that require certain license applications to be denied. In addition, these sections include license review standards for export, reexport, and in-country transfer license applications submitted as required by these sections. It should also be noted that part 764 of the EAR prohibits exports, reexports, and certain transfers of items subject to the EAR to denied parties. Section 744.21 imposes restrictions for exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) of item subject to the EAR listed in supplement no. 2 to this part for a military end use or military end user in Burma, Cambodia, the People's Republic of China (PRC or China), Nicaragua, or Venezuela and for a Burmese, Cambodian, Chinese, Nicaraguan, or Venezuelan military end user if identified in supplement no. 7 to this part. Section 744.21 also imposes restrictions for exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) for all items subject to the EAR for a military end use or military end user in Belarus or Russia and for a Belarusian or Russian military end user wherever located if identified on supplement no. 4 to this part. Section 744.22 imposes restrictions on exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) for a military-intelligence end use or military-intelligence end user in Burma, China, Russia, or Venezuela; or for a country listed in Country Groups E:1 or E:2 (see supplement no. 1 to part 740 of the EAR). Section 744.23 sets forth restrictions on exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) for certain \u201csupercomputer\u201d and semiconductor manufacturing end use.",
            "(2) If controls set forth under more than one section of part 744 apply to a person, the license requirements for such a person will be determined based on the requirements of all applicable sections of part 744, and license applications will be reviewed under all applicable licensing policies.",
            "(b) Steps. The following are steps you should follow in using the provisions of this part:",
            "(1) Review end-use and end-user prohibitions. First, review each end-use and end-user prohibition described in this part to learn the scope of these prohibitions.",
            "(2)  Determine applicability. Second, determine whether any of the end-use and end-user prohibitions described in this part are applicable to your planned export, reexport, shipment, transmission, transfer (in-country) or other activity. See supplement no. 1 to part 732 for guidance. For exports, reexports, shipments, transmissions, or transfers (in-country) that are in transit at the time you are informed by BIS that a license is required in accordance with \u00a7\u00a7 744.2(b), 744.3(b), 744.4(b), 744.6(c), 744.9(b), 744.11(c), 744.17(b), 744.21(b), or 744.22(b) of the EAR, you may not proceed any further with the transaction unless you first obtain a license from BIS (see part 748 of the EAR for instructions on how to apply for a license). The provisions of \u00a7 748.4(d)(2) of the EAR shall not apply to license applications submitted pursuant to a notification from BIS that occurs while an export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) is in transit."

An entity or address that presents a high diversion risk may pose a significant risk through certain circumstances that may be outside of its own control or in the case of addresses with high diversion risk, outside the control of certain parties to the transaction operating at such address that presents a high diversion risk. Such circumstances that may place an entity or address that presents a high diversion risk include situations involving a sustained lack of cooperation by a host government authority, for example, by preventing an end-use check from being conducted, that effectively prevents BIS from determining compliance with the EAR. This section may not be used to place any U.S. person, as defined in \u00a7 772.1 of the EAR, on the Entity List. Paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) of this section provide an illustrative list of activities that could be or represent a significant risk of being contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States, including the foreign policy interest of the protection of human rights throughout the world.",

The conduct in this example includes: expressly refusing to permit a check; providing false or misleading information; or engaging in dilatory or evasive conduct that effectively prevents the check from occurring or makes the check inaccurate or useless. A nexus between the conduct of the party or address that presents a high diversion risk to be listed and the failure to produce a complete, accurate and useful check is required, even though an express refusal by the party to be listed is not required; or",

In addition, most other items subject to the EAR, but not included on the CCL, designated by the Number \u201cEAR99\u201d, require a license to Cuba. Most items requiring a license to these destinations are subject to a general policy of denial. Because these controls extend to virtually all exports, they do not appear in the Country Chart in part 738 of the EAR, nor are they reflected in the Commerce Control List in part 774 of the EAR.",

The President also exercised national security waiver authority pursuant to Section 5(b) of the SAA for certain transactions. Section 746.9 of this part sets forth the specific license requirements, licensing policy and license exceptions applicable to Syria as a sanctioned country under the EAR. These provisions were issued consistent with Executive Order 13338 of May 11, 2004 which implemented the SAA.",

          "heading": "\u00a7 748.3   Classification requests and advisory opinions.",
          "paragraphs": [
            "(a) Introduction. You may ask BIS to provide you with the correct Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) down to the paragraph (or subparagraph) level, if appropriate. BIS will issue you a determination that each item identified in your classification request is either described by an ECCN in the Commerce Control List (CCL) in supplement no. 1 to part 774 of the EAR or not described by an ECCN and, therefore, an \u201cEAR99\u201d item. These classification determinations issued by BIS are not U.S. Government determinations that the items described therein are \u201csubject to the EAR,\u201d as this term is defined in \u00a7 734.3 of the EAR. Those who request commodity classifications and advisory opinions should have determined that the items at issue are not subject to the exclusive export control jurisdiction of one of the other U.S. Government agencies listed in \u00a7 734.3(b) of the EAR. If requested, for a given end-use, end-user, and/or destination, BIS will advise you whether a license is required, or likely to be granted, for a particular transaction. Note that these responses do not bind BIS to issuing a license in the future. This type of request, along with requests for guidance regarding other interpretations of the EAR, is commonly referred to as an \u201cAdvisory Opinion.\u201d The encryption provisions in the EAR require the submission of a classification request in accordance with \u00a7 740.17(d) of the EAR in order for certain items to be eligible for export and reexport under License Exception ENC (see \u00a7 740.17 of the EAR) or to be released from \u201cEI\u201d controls (see \u00a7\u00a7 740.17(b)(2) and 740.17(b)(3) of the EAR).",
            "(b) Classification requests. Submit classification requests in accordance with the procedures in \u00a7 748.1.",
            "(1) Each Classification Request must be limited to six items. Exceptions may be granted by BIS on a case-by-case basis for several related items if the relationship between the items is satisfactorily substantiated in the request. Classification requests must be supported by any descriptive literature, brochures, precise technical specifications or papers that describe the items in sufficient technical detail to enable classification by BIS submitted as PDF files attached to the SNAP-R submission unless a paper submission is authorized pursuant to \u00a7 748.1 of the EAR.",
            "(2) When submitting a classification request, you must complete Blocks 1 through 5, 14, 22(a), (b), (c), (d), and (i), 24, and 25 on the application. You must provide a recommended classification in Block 22(a) and explain the basis for your recommendation based on the technical parameters specified in the appropriate ECCN in Block 24. If you are unable to determine a recommended classification for your item, include an explanation in Block 24, identifying the ambiguities or deficiencies that precluded you from making a recommended classification.",
            "(3) BIS assigns each of its commodity classifications a Commodity Classification Automated Tracking System (CCATS) number. Neither the BIS classification nor the CCATS number may be relied upon or cited as evidence that the U.S. Government has determined that the items described in the commodity classification determination are subject to the EAR (See 15 CFR 734.3).",
            "(c) Advisory opinions. Advisory opinion requests must be made in writing, and may be delivered to BIS by mail, by email, or through the BIS website. If delivering a request by mail, submit to the address listed in \u00a7 748.1(d)(2). Both your letter and envelope must be marked \u201cAdvisory Opinion.\u201d If submitting by email, submit to RPD2@bis.doc.gov with the subject title \u201cAdvisory Opinion.\u201d If submitting through the BIS website, see http://www.bis.doc.gov.",
            "(1) Your submission must contain the following information if you are requesting guidance regarding interpretations of the EAR:",
            "(i) The name, title, and telephone and facsimile numbers of the person to contact,",
            "(ii) Your complete address comprised of street address, city, state, country, and postal code; and",
            "(2) If you are requesting BIS to determine whether a license is required, or the licensing policy related to a particular end-use, end-user, and/or destination, in addition to the information required in \u00a7 748.3(c)(1) you must also include:",
            "(i) All available information on the parties to the transaction and the proposed end-use or end-user,",
            "(ii) The model number for each item, where appropriate,",
            "(iii) The Export Control Classification Number, if known, for each item; and",
            "(iv) Any descriptive literature, brochures, technical specifications or papers that describe the items in sufficient technical detail to enable BIS to verify the correct classification.",
            "(3) Requests for Validated End-User authorization should be submitted in accordance with the provisions set forth in \u00a7 748.15 and supplement nos. 8 and 9 to this part.",
            "(4) To request an addition or modification to or removal from the approved integrated circuit designers list in supplement no. 6 to part 740 of the EAR or the approved \u201cOSAT\u201d companies list in supplement no. 7 to part 740 of the EAR, see \u00a7 748.16 of this part.",
            "(5) Advisory opinions are limited in scope to BIS's interpretation of EAR provisions. Advisory opinions differ from commodity classifications in that advisory opinions are not limited to the interpretation of provisions contained in the Commerce Control List. Advisory opinions may not be relied upon or cited as evidence that the U.S. Government has determined that the items described in the advisory opinion are not subject to the export control jurisdiction of another agency of the U.S. Government (See 15 CFR 734.3).",
            "(d) Classification requests for encryption items. A classification request associated with encryption items transferred from the U.S. Munitions List consistent with Executive Order 13026 of November 15, 1996 (3 CFR, 1996 Comp., p. 228) and pursuant to the Presidential Memorandum of that date may be required to determine eligibility under License Exception ENC or for release from \u201cEI\u201d controls. Refer to supplement no. 6 to part 742 of the EAR for a complete list of technical information that is required for encryption classification requests. Refer to \u00a7 740.17(e)(3) and supplement no. 8 to part 742 of the EAR for information that is required to be submitted in a self-classification report. Refer to \u00a7 740.17(b) of the EAR for instructions regarding mass market encryption commodities and software, including self-classifications and classification requests. Refer to \u00a7 740.17 of the EAR for the provisions of License Exception ENC, including encryption self-classifications, classification requests and sales reporting. All classification requests, notifications and reports submitted to BIS pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 740.17 and 742.15(b) of the EAR will be reviewed by the ENC Encryption Request Coordinator, Ft. Meade, MD.",
            "(e) Classification requests to confirm that a \u201cpart,\u201d \u201ccomponent,\u201d \u201caccessory,\u201d \u201cattachment,\u201d or \u201csoftware\u201d is not \u201cspecially designed\u201d\u2014(1) Scope. If you have a \u201cpart,\u201d \u201ccomponent,\u201d \u201caccessory,\u201d \u201cattachment,\u201d or \u201csoftware\u201d that is \u201cspecially designed\u201d on the basis of paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of the \u201cspecially designed\u201d definition in \u00a7 772.1 of the EAR, you may submit a request in accordance with the procedures in \u00a7 748.1 to confirm that the item is not \u201cspecially designed\u201d provided you meet the following criteria:",
            "(i) The \u201cpart,\u201d \u201ccomponent,\u201d \u201caccessory,\u201d \u201cattachment,\u201d or \u201csoftware\u201d does not meet the criteria of exclusion paragraph (b)(3) of the \u201cspecially designed\u201d definition, but would meet the criteria if the minor changes in form or fit were determined to be insignificant by the U.S. Government.",
            "(ii) The performance capabilities of the \u201cpart,\u201d \u201ccomponent,\u201d \u201caccessory,\u201d \u201cattachment,\u201d or \u201csoftware\u201d are the same as those of a \u201cpart,\u201d \u201ccomponent,\u201d \u201caccessory,\u201d \u201cattachment,\u201d or \u201csoftware\u201d that would meet the criteria of exclusion paragraph (b)(3) of the definition of \u201cspecially designed\u201d in \u00a7 772.1 of the EAR.",
            "(2) Information to be provided. Applicants wishing to submit a CCATS requesting confirmation that a \u201cpart,\u201d \u201ccomponent,\u201d \u201caccessory,\u201d \u201cattachment,\u201d or \u201csoftware\u201d is not \u201cspecially designed\u201d must submit classification requests in accordance with the procedures in \u00a7 748.1 and general provisions regarding submitting classification requests in \u00a7 748.3(b). In addition, applicants must submit additional information identified in this paragraph (e)(2).",
            "(i) The classification request must indicate in Block 24 or in a separate PDF attachment included with the CCATS submission that the \u201cpart,\u201d \u201ccomponent,\u201d \u201caccessory,\u201d \u201cattachment\u201d or \u201csoftware\u201d would meet the criteria in paragraph (e)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section;",
            "(ii) A detailed explanation must be provided regarding all changes in form and fit; and",
            "(iii) A rationale must be provided that explains why such changes in form and fit should be treated as minor or insignificant in terms of their role in the performance capabilities of the enumerated item.",
            "(3) U.S. Government Review. Commodity classification requests submitted pursuant to \u00a7 748.3(e) are reviewed by the Departments of Commerce, State and Defense. A consensus determination is required to confirm that a \u201cpart,\u201d \u201ccomponent,\u201d \u201caccessory,\u201d \u201cattachment,\u201d or \u201csoftware\u201d is not \u201cspecially designed\u201d on the basis of this paragraph. The interagency review process will ensure U.S. national security and foreign policy interests are evaluated prior to any confirmation pursuant to \u00a7 748.3(e). The interagency review will consider on a case-by-case basis whether a particular \u201cpart,\u201d \u201ccomponent,\u201d \u201caccessory,\u201d \u201cattachment,\u201d or \u201csoftware\u201d is \u201cspecially designed\u201d taking into account all the following:",
            "(i) The insignificance of the changes in form and fit;",
            "(ii) The overall role of the \u201cpart,\u201d \u201ccomponent,\u201d \u201caccessory,\u201d \u201cattachment,\u201d or \u201csoftware\u201d in the performance capabilities of the enumerated or otherwise described item that it is used in or with;",
            "(iii) How substantively common it is to the other \u201cpart,\u201d \u201ccomponent,\u201d \u201caccessory,\u201d \u201cattachment,\u201d or \u201csoftware\u201d that would meet the paragraph (b)(3) criteria;",
            "(iv) Whether such a confirmation would be consistent with U.S. Government multilateral export control regime commitments; and",
            "(v) Any other criteria that may be relevant in determining whether the \u201cpart,\u201d \u201ccomponent,\u201d \u201caccessory,\u201d \u201cattachment,\u201d or \u201csoftware\u201d is \u201cspecially designed,\u201d including an evaluation of how such a confirmation may affect U.S. national security and foreign policy interests.",
            "(4) CCATS response. The BIS response to the CCATS request will reflect the interagency consensus determination and the response will be made in accordance with the procedures in \u00a7\u00a7 748.1 and 748.3(b). In addition, the BIS response will indicate one of the following:",
            "(i) The \u201cpart,\u201d \u201ccomponent,\u201d \u201caccessory,\u201d \u201cattachment,\u201d or \u201csoftware\u201d is not \u201cspecially designed\u201d on the basis of being within the scope of paragraph (b)(3) because the changes in form and fit have been determined by the U.S. Government to be minor or insignificant. In such cases, the new classification, which may be EAR99 or in another ECCN entry that does not use \u201cspecially designed,\u201d will be provided as part of the BIS response;\u201d",
            "(ii) The request under \u00a7 748.3(e) has been denied and the \u201cpart,\u201d \u201ccomponent,\u201d \u201caccessory,\u201d \u201cattachment,\u201d or \u201csoftware\u201d continues to be classified under a \u201cspecially designed\u201d \u2018catch-all\u2019 (see the definition of \u201cspecially designed\u201d in \u00a7 772.1 of the EAR). The response will also include a determination regarding where the \u201cspecially designed\u201d \u201cpart,\u201d \u201ccomponent,\u201d \u201caccessory,\u201d \u201cattachment,\u201d or \u201csoftware\u201d is classified on the CCL; or",
            "(iii) Returned without action (RWA) because insufficient information was provided or information was not provided in a timely fashion. These requests will be reviewed closely, and they will likely require additional follow up questions of applicants, so responding to such requests in a timely fashion will be an important part of the process to ensure such requests are considered by the U.S. Government.",
            "(f) Classification requests for artificial intelligence models. Classification requests may be submitted to confirm that technology is not controlled under ECCN 4E091 because the artificial intelligence model has been trained utilizing fewer computational 'operations' than the number needed to train a model as capable, according to an average of widely used benchmarks, as the most advanced artificial intelligence model that has been \u201cpublished\u201d as defined in \u00a7 734.7(a) of the EAR. Refer to the technical notes to ECCN 4E091 for instructions regarding self-classifications of artificial intelligence models."

Special instructions for applications requiring such additional information are listed in \u00a7 748.8 and described fully in supplement no. 2 to this part.",

            "(b) Application Control Number. Each application has an application control number.The Application Control Number, consisting of a letter followed by six digits, is for use by BIS when processing applications, and by applicants when communicating with BIS concerning pending applications. This number is used for tracking purposes within the U.S. Government. The Application Control Number is not a license number.",

However, you may specifically request that your license application be considered as a whole and either approved or denied in its entirety.",
            "(d) Combining items on license applications. Any items may be combined on a single application, however, if the items differ dramatically (e.g., computers and shotguns) the number of BIS offices to which a license application may be referred for review may increase significantly. Accordingly, it is recommended that you limit items on each license application to those that are similar and/or related.",
            "(e) Attachments to applications. Documents required to be submitted with applications filed via SNAP-R must be submitted as PDF files using the procedures described in SNAP-R. Documents required to be submitted with paper applications must bear the application control number to which they relate and, if applicable, be stapled to the paper form. Where necessary, BIS may require you to submit additional information beyond that stated in the EAR confirming or amplifying information contained in your license application.",
            "(f) Changes in facts. Answers to all items on the license application will be deemed to be continuing representations of the existing facts or circumstances. Any material or substantive change in the terms of the order, or in the facts relating to the transaction, must be promptly reported to BIS, whether a license has been granted or the license application is still under consideration. If a license has been granted and such changes are not excepted in \u00a7 750.7(c) of the EAR, they must be reported immediately to BIS, even though shipments against the license may be partially or wholly completed, during the validity period of the license.",
            "(g) Request for extended license validity period. An extended validity period will generally be granted if your transaction is related to a multi-year project, when production lead time will not permit export or reexport during the normal validity period or for other similar circumstances. A continuing requirement to supply spare or replacement parts will not normally justify an extended validity period. To request an extended validity period, include justification for your request in Block 24 on the application."

            "Validated end-users (VEU) are those who have been previously approved by BIS pursuant to the requirements of this section. To be eligible for authorization VEU, exporters, reexporters, and validated end-user applicants must adhere to the conditions and restrictions set forth in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section. If a request for VEU Authorization for a particular end-user is not granted, no new license requirement is triggered. In addition, such a result does not render the end user ineligible for license approvals from BIS. There are two types of VEU authorization: General VEU Authorization and Data Center VEU Authorization. General VEU Authorizations permit the export, reexport, and transfer to validated end-users of any eligible items that will be used in a specific eligible destination. Data Center VEU Authorizations permit the export and reexport to validated end-users of any eligible items that will be used in specific data centers. A data center is a facility or \u201cfacilities\u201d that house a multi-racked, networked computer system that include servers, storage devices, and networking equipment. Data Center VEU Authorizations may be either universal or national authorizations.",
            "(a)(1) Eligible end-users for General VEU Authorizations and Data Center VEU Authorizations. The only end users to whom eligible items may be exported, reexported, or transferred under a General VEU Authorization or a Data Center VEU Authorization are those validated end-users identified in supplement no. 7 to this part. Those entities were added as VEUs according to the provisions in this section and supplement nos. 8 and 9 to this part.",
            "(2) Requests for authorizations\u2014(i) Advisory opinion. To apply for a General VEU Authorization or Data Center VEU Authorization, requests for authorization must be submitted in the form of an advisory opinion request, as described in \u00a7 748.3(c), and must include a list of items (except as excluded by paragraph (c) of this section), identified by ECCN, intended for export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) to an eligible end-user, once approved.",
            "(ii) Applications for Universal VEU (UVEU) Authorization\u2014(A) Application Overview. A UVEU authorization should be submitted by the owner of the advanced computing ICs. To qualify for UVEU authorization, the owner of the advanced computing ICs must certify that it will follow the guidelines in supplement no. 10 to this part. The owner of the advanced compute must certify that it will follow the guidelines in paragraphs 14, 15, and 18 of supplement no. 10 to this part on or before January 15, 2026. If the owner of the advanced computing ICs cannot certify to all of the guidelines in supplement no. 10 to this part, it must notify BIS in its application of the other entities involved in its operations. The applicant must also provide signed certifications from such entities as set forth in supplement no. 10 to this part. For UVEUs, if the operator of the advanced compute is different from the owner of the advanced compute, the operator must itself have an Authorization UVEU. As appropriate, BIS will adjudicate complete UVEU applications within 30 days of receipt. A UVEU will need to file a notification with BIS when building a datacenter in a new location 180 days before any exports, reexports, or transfers (in-country) to the new datacenter. The notification should include the physical address of the new data center location. BIS will use this information to update the eligible destination column in the validated end user list in supplement no. 7 to this part. The UVEU may choose whether to list a corporate address or a physical address of the new data center location. The UVEU may furnish its BIS authorization letter as proof of its authorization to receive exports, reexports, or transfers (in-country) prior to the publication of an amendment to supplement no. 7 to this part that includes a physical address, or where supplement no. 7 includes a corporate address but not a physical address. No other requirements may be placed on the UVEU beyond those described in supplement no. 10 to this part as a condition for granting the original UVEU application.",

            "(iii) Applications for National VEU (NVEU) Authorization\u2014(A) Application Overview. The NVEU Authorization will allow an entity to receive exports and reexports in a specific country as specified in their NVEU authorization. For every additional country in which the NVEU wants to operate, the owner of the advanced compute must obtain a separate NVEU authorization. To qualify for NVEU authorization, the owner of the advanced computing ICs must adhere to guidelines provided in supplement no. 10 to this part but, depending on its location and the national security and foreign policy risks associated with that location, may be subject to other requirements. The owner of the advanced compute must certify that it will follow the guidelines in paragraphs 14, 15, and 18 of supplement no. 10 to this part on or before January 15, 2026. If the owner of the advanced computing ICs cannot certify to all of the guidelines in supplement no. 10 to this part, it must notify BIS in its application of the other entities involved in its operations. Applicants must provide written assurances from those other entities consistent with supplement no. 10 to this part during the application review process. Government-to-Government assurances between the United States and the government of the country in which the NVEU wishes to operate may be sought before a NVEU is granted. Where multiple entities will own and operate the NVEU they should submit a joint application. For NVEUs, if the operator of the advanced compute is different from the owner of the advanced compute, the operator must itself have its own Authorization NVEU. After receiving NVEU Authorization, the NVEU will be listed as such in supplement no. 7 to this part. The NVEU may inform BIS if it prefers that supplement no. 7 list a corporate address or a physical address of the new data center location. Once approved for Authorization NVEU by BIS, the NVEU may furnish its BIS authorization letter that includes physical addresses as proof of its authorization to receive exports, reexports, or transfers (in-country) prior to the publication of an amendment to supplement no. 7 that includes a physical address, or where supplement no. 7 includes a corporate address but not a physical address.",

Processing times for the purposes of this section are defined in calendar days. The procedures and time limits described in this part apply to all license applications registered on or after February 4, 1996. The procedures and time limits in effect prior to December 6, 1995 will apply to license applications registered prior to February 4, 1996.",
            "(2) Properly completed license applications will be registered promptly upon receipt by BIS. Registration is defined as the point at which the application is entered into BIS's electronic license processing system. If your application contains deficiencies that prevent BIS from registering your application, BIS will attempt to contact you to correct the deficiencies, however, if BIS is unable to contact you, the license application will be returned without being registered. The specific deficiencies requiring return will be enumerated in a notice accompanying the returned license application. If a license application is registered, but BIS is unable to correct deficiencies crucial to processing the license application, it will be returned without action. The notice will identify the deficiencies and the action necessary to correct the deficiencies. If you decide to resubmit the license application, it will be treated as a new license application when calculating license processing time frames.",
            "(b) Actions not included in processing time calculations. The following actions will not be counted in the time period calculations described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section for the processing of license applications:",

BIS may request applicants to provide additional information in support of their license application, respond to questions arising during processing, or accept proposed conditions or riders on their license application. If BIS has provided the applicant with an intent to deny letter described in \u00a7 750.6 of this part, processing times may be suspended in order to negotiate modifications to a license application and obtain agreement to such modifications from the foreign parties to the license application.",
            "(2) Pre-license checks. BIS conducts pre-license checks in order to establish the identity and reliability of the recipient of the items subject to the EAR that require a license, as well as to substantiate representations made on the license application. The results of the pre-license check, including the U.S. government's inability to conduct the pre-license check due to the end user's or host government's actions, will be considered in determining the outcome of a license application. The time required to conduct a pre-license check is not included in license application processing time calculations according to this paragraph, if the pre-license check is:",
            "(i) Conducted through government channels, and",

            "(B) The new HTS-6 Code under supplements nos. 2, 4, or 5 to part 746 or item identified under supplement no. 6 to part 746 was added to the EAR after the validation date of the BIS license;",
            "(C) The BIS license has not yet expired; and",
            "(D) The export, reexport, or in-country transfer of these additional HTS-6 Codes under supplements nos. 2, 4, or 5 to part 746 or items identified under supplement no. 6 to part 746 will not exceed the shipping tolerance of the original license or the number of units authorized under the original license.",
            "(2) In some circumstances, BIS may authorize changing the name of a person listed on a license (i.e., name of exporter, reexporter, purchaser, intermediate consignee, ultimate consignee or end user), provided the pertinent person has not undergone a change in ownership, including merger or acquisition, or any other change in legal status since the time the license was issued. In order to rely on this paragraph (c)(2), BIS must have approved the name change in response to an advisory opinion request submitted by the licensee pursuant to \u00a7 748.3(c) of the EAR and the instructions below.",
            "(i) The advisory opinion request must be submitted on the licensee's company letterhead and include the following information:",
            "(A) The title of the advisory opinion, in this format: \u201cLicense name change notification and review request;\u201d",
            "(B) All license numbers subject to the notification and review request (either in the letter or as a separate attachment);",
            "(C) The name(s) changing on the license(s) (include the original and new names), and when the name(s) are changing (either in the letter or as a separate attachment);",
            "(D) Any background information available on the reasons for the name change(s) (e.g., press releases from the person changing its name(s)); and",
            "(E) A statement regarding whether there has been a change in ownership, including a merger or acquisition, or any other change in legal status regarding the person(s) changing its name(s).",
            "(F) Confirmation that, if the request is approved, the licensee will share the advisory opinion response from BIS with all other persons listed on the license, and inform those persons that the advisory opinion response must be retained pursuant to the recordkeeping requirements in part 762 of the EAR.",
            "(ii) If BIS determines the name change is not a material change to the license and approves the request to change the name(s) on the license, BIS will send a written response to the licensee who submitted the notification. If BIS does not approve the request to change the name(s) on the license, BIS will send a written response to the licensee who submitted the notification.",
            "(iii) For guidance on using an export license with approved name changes, see \u00a7 758.4(d) (Exports against license with approved name change).",
            "(iv) If a license name change notification and review request is denied by BIS or the licensee determines that there has been a material change to the license, such as a change in ownership of a person on the license, including merger or acquisition, or any other change in legal status since the time the license was issued, a new license application should be submitted.",
            "(d) Responsibility of the licensee. The person to whom a license is issued is the licensee. In export transactions, the exporter must be the licensee, and the exporter-licensee is responsible for the proper use of the license, and for all terms and conditions of the license, except to the extent that certain terms and conditions are directed toward some other party to the transaction. In reexport or routed export transactions, a U.S. agent acting on behalf of a foreign principal party in interest may be the licensee; in these cases, both the agent and the foreign principal party in interest, on whose behalf the agent has acted, are responsible for the use of the license, and for all terms and conditions of the license, except to the extent that certain terms and conditions are directed toward some other party to the transaction. It is the licensee's responsibility to communicate in writing the specific license conditions to the parties to whom those conditions apply. In addition, when required by the license, the licensee is responsible for obtaining written acknowledgment(s) of receipt of the conditions from the party(ies) to whom those conditions apply.",
            "(e) Prohibited use of a license. No person convicted of a violation of any statute specified in section 11(h) of the EAA, at the discretion of the Secretary of Commerce, may apply for any license for a period up to 10 years from the date of the conviction. See \u00a7 766.25 of the EAR.",
            "(f) Quantity of commodities authorized. Unlike software and technology, commodities will be approved with a quantity and dollar value limit. Any license resulting from a license application to export or reexport commodities will be licensed in terms of the specified unit of quantity commonly used in trade. A total dollar value for the commodity will be authorized based on the per unit price of the commodity. Subject to the shipping tolerances authorized in \u00a7 750.11 of this part, the authorization is limited by both the quantity and value listed on the license.",
            "(g) License validity period. Licenses involving the export or reexport of items will generally have a four-year validity period, unless a different validity period has been requested and specifically approved by BIS or is otherwise specified on the license at the time that it is issued. Exceptions from the four-year validity period include: license applications for items controlled for short supply reasons, which will be limited to a one-year validity period during which the items must be exported, re-exported, or transferred (in country) and license applications reviewed and approved as an \u201cemergency\u201d (see \u00a7 748.4(h) of the EAR); and items controlled under ECCNs 0A501, 0A502, 0A504, 0A505, 0A506, 0A507, 0A508, 0A509, or listed in \u00a7 742.6(a)(6)(iii)(A) of the EAR, which will generally be limited to a one-year validity period during which the items must be exported, re-exported, or transferred (in country). Emergency licenses will expire no later than the last day of the calendar month following the month in which the emergency license is issued. The expiration date will be clearly stated on the face of the license. If the expiration date falls on a legal holiday (Federal or State), the validity period is automatically extended to midnight of the first business day following the expiration date.",
            "(1) Extended validity period. BIS will consider granting a validity period exceeding four years (or exceeding one year for applications subject to that shorter validity period) on a case-by-case basis when extenuating circumstances warrant such an extension. Requests for such extensions may be made at the time of application or after the license has been issued and it is still valid. BIS will not approve changes regarding other aspects of the license, such as the parties to the transaction and the countries of ultimate destination. An extended validity period will generally be granted where, for example, the transaction is related to a multi-year project; when the period corresponds to the duration of a manufacturing license agreement, technical assistance agreement, warehouse and distribution agreement, or license issued under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations; when production lead time will not permit an export or reexport during the original validity period of the license; when an unforeseen emergency prevents shipment within the 4-year validity of the license; or for other similar circumstances.",
            "(2) Request for extension. (i) The applicant must submit a letter in writing to request an extension in the validity period of a previously approved license. The subject of the letter must be titled: \u201cRequest for Validity Period Extension\u201d and contain the following information:",
            "(A) The name, address, and telephone number of the requestor;",
            "(B) A copy of the original license, with the license number, validation date, and current expiration date legible; and",
            "(C) Justification for the extension;",
            "(ii) It is the responsibility of the applicant to ensure that all applicable support documents remain valid and are in the possession of the applicant. If the request for extension is approved, BIS will provide the applicant with a written response.",
            "(h) Specific types of licenses\u2014(1) Licenses for temporary exports or reexports. If you have been granted a license for the temporary export or reexport of items and you decide not to return the items to the United States, you must submit a license application requesting authorization to dispose of the items. Except when the items are to be used on a temporary basis at a new destination (and returned to the United States after such use), you must ensure that your license application is accompanied by all documents that would be required if you had requested a license to export or reexport the same item directly to the new destination.",
            "(2) Intransit within the United States. If you have been issued a license authorizing an intransit shipment (that does not qualify for the intransit provisions of License Exception TMP) through the United States, your license will be valid only for the export of the intransit shipment wholly of foreign origin and for which a Transportation and Exportation customs entry or an Immediate Exportation customs entry is outstanding.",
            "(3) Intransit outside the United States. If you have been issued a license authorizing unlading or transit through a country listed in the General Prohibition Eight contained in \u00a7 736.2(b)(8) of the EAR, and you did not know the identity of the intermediate consignee at the time of the original license application, you must notify BIS in writing once you have ascertained the identity of the intermediate consignee. Your notification must contain the original license number, and the complete name, address, and telephone number of the intermediate consignee. The written request must be submitted to BIS at the address listed in \u00a7 748.1(d)(2) of the EAR.",
            "(4) Replacement license. If you have been issued a \u201creplacement license\u201d (for changes to your original license not covered in paragraph (c) of this section), you must retain both the original and the replacement license.",
            "(i) Terminating license conditions. Exporters or reexporters who have shipped under licenses with conditions that would not apply to an export under a License Exception or if no license was required, and foreign consignees who have agreed to such conditions, are no longer bound by these conditions when the licensed items become eligible for a License Exception or can be exported or reexported without a license. Items that become eligible for a License Exception are subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable License Exception and to the restrictions in \u00a7 740.2 of the EAR. Items that become eligible for export without a license remain subject to the EAR and any export, reexport, or disposition of such items may only be made in accordance with the requirements of the EAR. Termination of license conditions does not relieve an exporter or reexporter of its responsibility for violations that occurred prior to the availability of a License Exception or prior to the removal of license requirements.",
            "(j) Records. If you have been issued a license you must retain the license, and maintain complete records in accordance with part 762 of the EAR including any licenses (whether used or unused, valid or expired) and all supporting documents and shipping records."

BIS's Office of Exporter Services may revoke any license in which a person who has been convicted of one of the statutes specified in section 11(h) of the EAA, at the discretion of the Secretary of Commerce, has an interest in the license at the time of the conviction. It may be necessary for BIS to stop a shipment or an export or reexport transaction at any stage in the process (e.g., in order to prevent an unauthorized export or reexport). If a shipment is already en route, it may be further necessary for BIS to order the return or unloading of such shipment at any port of call in accordance with the provisions of the EAA.",

The duplicate license will be labeled \u201cDuplicate for Hong Kong Trade Department\u201d. This duplicate must be forwarded to the reexporter or intermediate consignee for submission to the Hong Kong Trade Department.

Two electronic filing options (predeparture and postdeparture) are available for transmitting EEI. Predeparture filing requires that all information be reported in AES prior to export (15 CFR 30.4(a) and (b) of the FTR). Postdeparture filing is available only for approved companies (approved by the Census Bureau, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and BIS) and requires no information to be transmitted prior to export with complete information reported postdeparture no later than five (5) calendar days after the date of exportation (15 CFR 30.4(c) of the FTR).",

Exporters, or agents applying on behalf of an exporter, may apply for postdeparture privileges by submitting a Letter of Intent to the Bureau of Census (Census Bureau) Census Bureau in accordance with 15 CFR 30.5(a) of the FTR. The Census Bureau will distribute the Letter of Intent to BIS and other agencies participating in the postdeparture approval process. Any agency may notify the Census Bureau that an applicant has failed to meet its acceptance standards, and the Census Bureau will provide a denial letter to the applicant naming the denying agency. If the Census Bureau receives neither notification of denial, nor a request for an extension from the agency within 30 days of the date of referral of the letter of intent to the agency, the applicant is deemed to be approved by that agency.

The exporter must determine licensing authority (License, License Exception, or NLR), and obtain the appropriate license or other authorization. The exporter may hire forwarding or other agents to perform various tasks, but doing so does not necessarily relieve the exporter of compliance responsibilities.",

            "(2) A United States person has the intent to comply with, further, or support an unsanctioned foreign boycott when such a boycott is at least one of the reasons for that person's decision whether to take a particular prohibited action. So long as that is at least one of the reasons for that person's action, a violation occurs regardless of whether the prohibited action is also taken for non-boycott reasons. Stated differently, the fact that such action was taken for legitimate business reasons does not remove that action from the scope of this part if compliance with an unsanctioned foreign boycott was also a reason for the action.",
            "(3) Intent is a necessary element of any violation of any of the prohibitions under \u00a7 760.2. It is not sufficient that one take action that is specifically prohibited by this part. It is essential that one take such action with intent to comply with, further,or support an unsanctioned foreign boycott. Accordingly, a person who inadvertently, without boycott intent, takes a prohibited action, does not commit any violation of this part.",
            "(4) Intent in this context means the reason or purpose for one's behavior. It does not mean that one has to agree with the boycott in question or desire that it succeed or that it be furthered or supported. But it does mean that the reason why a particular prohibited action was taken must be established.",
            "(5) Reason or purpose can be proved by circumstantial evidence. For example, if a person receives a request to supply certain boycott information, the furnishing of which is prohibited by this part, and he knowingly supplies that information in response, he clearly intends to comply with that boycott request. It is irrelevant that he may disagree with or object to the boycott itself. Information will be deemed to be furnished with the requisite intent if the person furnishing the information knows that it was sought for boycott purposes. On the other hand, if a person refuses to do business with someone who happens to be blacklisted, but the reason is because that person produces an inferior product, the requisite intent does not exist.",
            "(6) Actions will be deemed to be taken with intent to comply with an unsanctioned foreign boycott if the person taking such action knew that such action was required or requested for boycott reasons. On the other hand, the mere absence of a business relationship with a blacklisted person or with or in a boycotted country does not indicate the existence of the requisite intent.",
            "(7) In seeking to determine whether the requisite intent exists, all available evidence will be examined."

            "(a) Refusals to do business.",
            "(1) No United States person may: refuse, knowingly agree to refuse, require any other person to refuse, or knowingly agree to require any other person to refuse, to do business with or in a boycotted country, with any business concern organized under the laws of a boycotted country, with any national or resident of a boycotted country, or with any other person, when such refusal is pursuant to an agreement with the boycotting country, or a requirement of the boycotting country, or a request from or on behalf of the boycotting country.",
            "(2) Generally, a refusal to do business under this section consists of action that excludes a person or country from a transaction for boycott reasons. This includes a situation in which a United States person chooses or selects one person over another on a boycott basis or takes action to carry out another person's boycott-based selection when he knows or has reason to know that the other person's selection is boycott-based.",
            "(3) Refusals to do business which are prohibited by this section include not only specific refusals, but also refusals implied by a course or pattern of conduct. There need not be a specific offer and refusal to constitute a refusal to do business; a refusal may occur when a United States person has a financial or commercial opportunity and declines for boycott reasons to consider or accept it.",
            "(4) A United States person's use of either a boycott-based list of persons with whom he will not deal (a so-called \u201cblacklist\u201d) or a boycott-based list of persons with whom he will deal (a so-called \u201cwhitelist\u201d) constitutes a refusal to do business.",
            "(5) An agreement by a United States person to comply generally with the laws of the boycotting country with which it is doing business or an agreement that local laws of the boycotting country shall apply or govern is not, in and of itself, a refusal to do business. Nor, in and of itself, is use of a contractual clause explicitly requiring a person to assume the risk of loss of non-delivery of his products a refusal to do business with any person who will not or cannot comply with such a clause. (But see \u00a7 760.4 of this part on \u201cEvasion.\u201d)",
            "(6) If, for boycott reasons, a United States general manager chooses one supplier over another, or enters into a contract with one supplier over another, or advises its client to do so, then the general manager's actions constitute a refusal to do business under this section. However, it is not a refusal to do business under this section for a United States person to provide management, procurement, or other pre-award services for another person so long as the provision of such pre-award services is customary for that firm (or industry of which the firm is a part), without regard to the boycotting or non-boycotting character of the countries in which they are performed, and the United States person, in providing such services, does not act to exclude a person or country from the transaction for boycott reasons, or otherwise take actions that are boycott-based. For example, a United States person under contract to provide general management services in connection with a construction project in a boycotting country may compile lists of qualified bidders for the client if that service is a customary one and if persons who are qualified are not excluded from that list because they are blacklisted.",
            "(7) With respect to post-award services, if a client makes a boycott-based selection, actions taken by the United States general manager or contractor to carry out the client's choice are themselves refusals to do business if the United States contractor knows or has reason to know that the client's choice was boycott-based. (It is irrelevant whether the United States contractor also provided pre-award services.) Such actions include entering into a contract with the selected supplier, notifying the supplier of the client's choice, executing a contract on behalf of the client, arranging for inspection and shipment of the supplier's goods, or taking any other action to effect the client's choice. (But see \u00a7 760.3(d) on \u201cCompliance with Unilateral Selection\u201d as it may apply to post-award services.)",
            "(8) An agreement is not a prerequisite to a violation of this section since the prohibition extends to actions taken pursuant not only to agreements but also to requirements of, and requests from or on behalf of, a boycotting country.",
            "(9) Agreements under this section may be either express or implied by a course or pattern of conduct. There need not be a direct request from a boycotting country for action by a United States person to have been taken pursuant to an agreement with or requirement of a boycotting country.",
            "(10) This prohibition, like all others, applies only with respect to a United States person's activities in the interstate or foreign commerce of the United States and only when such activities are undertaken with intent to comply with, further, or support an unsanctioned foreign boycott. The mere absence of a business relationship with or in the boycotted country, with any business concern organized under the laws of the boycotted country, with national(s) or resident(s) of the boycotted country, or with any other person does not indicate the existence of the required intent.",
            "(b) Discriminatory actions.",
            "(1) No United States person may:",
            "(i) Refuse to employ or otherwise discriminate against any individual who is a United States person on the basis of race, religion, sex, or national origin;",
            "(ii) Discriminate against any corporation or other organization which is a United States person on the basis of the race, religion, sex, or national origin of any owner, officer, director, or employee of such corporation or organization;",
            "(iii) Knowingly agree to take any of the actions described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section; or",
            "(iv) Require or knowingly agree to require any other person to take any of the actions described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section.",
            "(2) This prohibition shall apply whether the discriminatory action is taken by a United States person on its own or in response to an agreement with, request from, or requirement of a boycotting country. This prohibition, like all others, applies only with respect to a United States person's activities in the interstate or foreign commerce of the United States and only when such activities are undertaken with intent to comply with, further, or support an unsanctioned foreign boycott.",
            "(3) The section does not supersede or limit the operation of the civil rights laws of the United States.",
            "(c) Furnishing information about race, religion, sex, or national origin.",
            "(1) No United States person may:",
            "(i) Furnish information about the race, religion, sex, or national origin of any United States person;",
            "(ii) Furnish information about the race, religion, sex, or national origin of any owner, officer, director, or employee of any corporation or other organization which is a United States person;",
            "(iii) Knowingly agree to furnish information about the race, religion, sex, or national origin of any United States person; or",
            "(iv) Knowingly agree to furnish information about the race, religion, sex, or national origin of any owner, officer, director, or employee of any corporation or other organization which is a United States person.",
            "(2) This prohibition shall apply whether the information is specifically requested or is offered voluntarily by the United States person. It shall also apply whether the information requested or volunteered is stated in the affirmative or the negative.",
            "(3) Information about the place of birth of or the nationality of the parents of a United States person comes within this prohibition, as does information in the form of code words or symbols which could identify a United States person's race, religion, sex, or national origin.",
            "(4) This prohibition, like all others, applies only with respect to a United States person's activities in the interstate or foreign commerce of the United States and only when such activities are undertaken with intent to comply with, further, or support an unsanctioned foreign boycott.",
            "(d) Furnishing information about business relationships with boycotted countries or blacklisted persons.",
            "(1) No United States person may furnish or knowingly agree to furnish information concerning his or any other person's past, present or proposed business relationships:",
            "(i) With or in a boycotted country;",
            "(ii) With any business concern organized under the laws of a boycotted country;",
            "(iii) With any national or resident of a boycotted country; or",
            "(iv) With any other person who is known or believed to be restricted from having any business relationship with or in a boycotting country.",
            "(2) This prohibition shall apply:",
            "(i) Whether the information pertains to a business relationship involving a sale, purchase, or supply transaction; legal or commercial representation; shipping or other transportation transaction; insurance; investment; or any other type of business transaction or relationship; and",
            "(ii) Whether the information is directly or indirectly requested or is furnished on the initiative of the United States person.",
            "(3) This prohibition does not apply to the furnishing of normal business information in a commercial context. Normal business information may relate to factors such as financial fitness, technical competence, or professional experience, and may be found in documents normally available to the public such as annual reports, disclosure statements concerning securities, catalogs, promotional brochures, and trade and business handbooks. Such information may also appear in specifications or statements of experience and qualifications.",
            "(4) Normal business information furnished in a commercial context does not cease to be such simply because the party soliciting the information may be a boycotting country or a national or resident thereof. If the information is of a type which is generally sought for a legitimate business purpose (such as determining financial fitness, technical competence, or professional experience), the information may be furnished even if the information could be used, or without the knowledge of the person supplying the information is intended to be used, for boycott purposes. However, no information about business relationships with blacklisted persons or boycotted countries, their residents or nationals, may be furnished in response to a boycott request, even if the information is publicly available. Requests for such information from a boycott office will be presumed to be boycott-based.",
            "(5) This prohibition, like all others, applies only with respect to a United States person's activities in the interstate or foreign commerce of the United States and only when such activities are undertaken with intent to comply with, further, or support an unsanctioned foreign boycott.",
            "(e) Information concerning association with charitable and fraternal organizations.",
            "(1) No United States person may furnish or knowingly agree to furnish information about whether any person is a member of, has made contributions to, or is otherwise associated with or involved in the activities of any charitable or fraternal organization which supports a boycotted country.",
            "(2) This prohibition shall apply whether:",
            "(i) The information concerns association with or involvement in any charitable or fraternal organization which (a) has, as one of its stated purposes, the support of a boycotted country through financial contributions or other means, or (b) undertakes, as a major organizational activity, to offer financial or other support to a boycotted country;",
            "(ii) The information is directly or indirectly requested or is furnished on the initiative of the United States person; or",
            "(iii) The information requested or volunteered concerns membership in, financial contributions to, or any other type of association with or involvement in the activities of such charitable or fraternal organization.",
            "(3) This prohibition does not prohibit the furnishing of normal business information in a commercial context as defined in paragraph (d) of this section.",
            "(4) This prohibition, like all others, applies only with respect to a United States person's activities in the interstate or foreign commerce of the United States and only when such activities are undertaken with intent to comply with, further, or support an unsanctioned foreign boycott.",
            "(f) Letters of credit.",
            "(1) No United States person may pay, honor, confirm, or otherwise implement a letter of credit which contains a condition or requirement compliance with which is prohibited by this part, nor shall any United States person, as a result of the application of this section, be obligated to pay, honor or otherwise implement such a letter of credit.",
            "(2) For purposes of this section, \u201cimplementing\u201d a letter of credit includes:",
            "(i) Issuing or opening a letter of credit at the request of a customer;",
            "(ii) Honoring, by accepting as being a valid instrument of credit, any letter of credit;",
            "(iii) Paying, under a letter of credit, a draft or other demand for payment by the beneficiary;",
            "(iv) Confirming a letter of credit by agreeing to be responsible for payment to the beneficiary in response to a request by the issuer;",
            "(v) Negotiating a letter of credit by voluntarily purchasing a draft from a beneficiary and presenting such draft for reimbursement to the issuer or the confirmer of the letter of credit; and",
            "(vi) Taking any other action to implement a letter of credit.",
            "(3) In the standard international letter of credit transaction facilitating payment for the export of goods from the United States, a bank in a foreign country may be requested by its customer to issue a revocable or irrevocable letter of credit in favor of the United States exporter. The customer usually requires, and the letter of credit provides, that the issuing (or a confirming) bank will make payment to the beneficiary against the bank's receipt of the documentation specified in the letter of credit. Such documentation usually includes commercial and consular invoices, a bill of lading, and evidence of insurance, but it may also include other required certifications or documentary assurances such as the origin of the goods and information relating to the carrier or insurer of the shipment.",
            "Banks usually will not accept drafts for payment unless the documents submitted therewith comply with the terms and conditions of the letter of credit.",
            "(4) A United States person is not prohibited under this section from advising a beneficiary of the existence of a letter of credit in his favor, or from taking ministerial actions to dispose of a letter of credit which it is prohibited from implementing.",
            "(5) Compliance with this section shall provide an absolute defense in any action brought to compel payment of, honoring of, or other implementation of a letter of credit, or for damages resulting from failure to pay or otherwise honor or implement the letter of credit. This section shall not otherwise relieve any person from any obligations or other liabilities he may incur under other laws or regulations, except as may be explicitly provided in this section.",
            "(6) This prohibition, like all others, applies only with respect to a United States person's activities taken with intent to comply with, further, or support an unsanctioned foreign boycott. In addition, it applies only when the transaction to which the letter of credit applies is in United States commerce and the beneficiary is a United States person.",
            "(7) A letter of credit implemented in the United States by a United States person located in the United States, including a permanent United States establishment of a foreign bank, will be presumed to apply to a transaction in United States commerce and to be in favor of a United States beneficiary where the letter of credit specifies a United States address for the beneficiary. These presumptions may be rebutted by facts which could reasonably lead the bank to conclude that the beneficiary is not a United States person or that the underlying transaction is not in United States commerce.",
            "(8) Where a letter of credit implemented in the United States by a United States person located in the United States does not specify a United States address for the beneficiary, the beneficiary will be presumed to be other than a United States person. This presumption may be rebutted by facts which could reasonably lead the bank to conclude that the beneficiary is a United States person despite the foreign address.",
            "(9) A letter of credit implemented outside the United States by a United States person located outside the United States will be presumed to apply to a transaction in United States commerce and to be in favor of a United States beneficiary where the letter of credit specifies a United States address for the beneficiary and calls for documents indicating shipment from the United States or otherwise indicating that the goods are of United States origin. These presumptions may be rebutted by facts which could reasonably lead the bank to conclude that the beneficiary is not a United States person or that the underlying transaction is not in United States commerce.",
            "(10) Where a letter of credit implemented outside the United States by a United States person located outside the United States does not specify a United States address for the beneficiary, the beneficiary will be presumed to be other than a United States person. In addition, where such a letter of credit does not call for documents indicating shipment from the United States or otherwise indicating that the goods are of United States origin, the transaction to which it applies will be presumed to be outside United States commerce. The presumption that the beneficiary is other than a United States person may be rebutted by facts which could reasonably lead the bank to conclude that the beneficiary is a United States person. The presumption that the transaction to which the letter of credit applies is outside United States commerce may be rebutted by facts which could reasonably lead the bank to conclude that the underlying transaction is in United States commerce."

            "(i) Goods or services from the boycotted country;",
            "(ii) Goods produced or services provided by any business concern organized under the laws of the boycotted country; or",
            "(iii) Goods produced or services provided by nationals or residents of the boycotted country.",
            "(2) A United States person may comply or agree to comply with such import requirements whether or not he has received a specific request to comply. By its terms, this exception applies only to transactions involving imports into a boycotting country. A United States person may not, under this exception, refuse on an across-the-board basis to do business with a boycotted country or a national or resident of a boycotted country.",
            "(3) In taking action within the scope of this exception, a United States person is limited in the types of boycott-related information he can supply. (See \u00a7 760.2(d) of this part on \u201cFurnishing Information About Business Relationships with Boycotted Countries or Blacklisted Persons\u201d and paragraph (c) of this section on \u201cImport and Shipping Document Requirements.\u201d)",
            "(b) Shipment of goods to a boycotting country.",
            "(1) A United States person, in shipping goods to a boycotting country, may comply or agree to comply with requirements of that country which prohibit the shipment of goods:",
            "(i) On a carrier of the boycotted country; or",
            "(ii) By a route other than that prescribed by the boycotting country or the recipient of the shipment.",
            "(2) A specific request that a United States person comply or agree to comply with requirements concerning the use of carriers of a boycotted country is not necessary if the United States person knows, or has reason to know, that the use of such carriers for shipping goods to the boycotting country is prohibited by requirements of the boycotting country. This exception applies whether a boycotting country or the purchaser of the shipment:",
            "(i) Explicitly states that the shipment should not pass through a port of the boycotted country; or",
            "(ii) Affirmatively describes a route of shipment that does not include a port in the boycotted country.",
            "(3) For purposes of this exception, the term carrier of a boycotted country means a carrier which flies the flag of a boycotted country or which is owned, chartered, leased, or operated by a boycotted country or by nationals or residents of a boycotted country.",
            "(c) Import and shipping document requirements.",
            "(1) A United States person, in shipping goods to a boycotting country, may comply or agree to comply with import and shipping document requirements of that country, with respect to:",
            "(i) The country or origin of the goods;",
            "(ii) The name and nationality of the carrier;",
            "(iii) The route of the shipment;",
            "(iv) The name, residence, or address of the supplier of the shipment;",
            "(v) The name, residence, or address of the provider of other services.",
            "(2) Such information must be stated in positive, non-blacklisting, non-exclusionary terms except for information with respect to the names or nationalities of carriers or routes of shipment, which may continue to be stated in negative terms in conjunction with shipments to a boycotting country, in order to comply with precautionary requirements protecting against war risks or confiscation.",
            "(d) Unilateral and specific selection.",
            "(1) A United States person may comply or agree to comply in the normal course of business with the unilateral and specific selection by a boycotting country, a national of a boycotting country, or a resident of a boycotting country (including a United States person who is a bona fide resident of a boycotting country) of carriers, insurers, suppliers of services to be performed within the boycotting country, or specific goods, provided that with respect to services, it is necessary and customary that a not insignificant part of the services be performed within the boycotting country. With respect to goods, the items, in the normal course of business, must be identifiable as to their source or origin at the time of their entry into the boycotting country by (a) uniqueness of design or appearance or (b) trademark, trade name, or other identification normally on the items themselves, including their packaging.",
            "(2) This exception pertains to what is permissible for a United States person who is the recipient of a unilateral and specific selection of goods or services to be furnished by a third person. It does not pertain to whether the act of making such a selection is permitted; that question is covered, with respect to United States persons, in paragraph (g) of this section on \u201cCompliance with Local Law.\u201d Nor does it pertain to the United States person who is the recipient of an order to supply its own goods or services. Nothing in this part prohibits or restricts a United States person from filling an order himself, even if he is selected by the buyer on a boycott basis (e.g., because he is not blacklisted), so long as he does not himself take any action prohibited by this part.",
            "(3) In order for this exception to apply, the selection with which a United States person wishes to comply must be unilateral and specific.",
            "(4) A \u201cspecific\u201d selection is one which is stated in the affirmative and which specifies a particular supplier of goods or services.",
            "(5) A \u201cunilateral\u201d selection is one in which the discretion in making the selection is exercised by the boycotting country buyer. If the United States person who receives a unilateral selection has provided the buyer with any boycott-based assistance (including information for purposes of helping the buyer select someone on a boycott basis), then the buyer's selection is not unilateral, and compliance with that selection by a United States person does not come within this exception.",
            "(6) The provision of so-called \u201cpre-selection\u201d or \u201cpre-award\u201d services, such as providing lists of qualified suppliers, subcontractors, or bidders, does not, in and of itself, destroy the unilateral character of a selection, provided such services are not boycott-based. Lists of qualified suppliers, for example, must not exclude anyone because he is blacklisted. Moreover, such services must be of the type customarily provided in similar transactions by the firm (or industry of which the firm is a part) as measured by the practice in non-boycotting as well as boycotting countries. If such services are not customarily provided in similar transactions or such services are provided in such a way as to exclude blacklisted persons from participating in a transaction or diminish their opportunity for such participation, then the services may not be provided without destroying the unilateral character of any subsequent selection.",
            "(7) In order for this exception to be available, the unilateral and specific selection must have been made by a boycotting country, or by a national or resident of a boycotting country. Such a resident may be a United States person. For purposes of this exception, a United States person will be considered a resident of a boycotting country only if he is a bona fide resident. A United States person may be a bona fide resident of a boycotting country even if such person's residency is temporary.",
            "(8) Factors that will be considered in determining whether a United States person is a bona fide resident of a boycotting country include:",
            "(i) Physical presence in the country;",
            "(ii) Whether residence is needed for legitimate business reasons;",
            "(iii) Continuity of the residency;",
            "(iv) Intent to maintain the residency;",
            "(v) Prior residence in the country;",
            "(vi) Size and nature of presence in the country;",
            "(vii) Whether the person is registered to do business or incorporated in the country;",
            "(viii) Whether the person has a valid work visa; and",
            "(ix) Whether the person has a similar presence in both boycotting and non-boycotting foreign countries in connection with similar business activities.",
            "(9) The boycotting country resident must be the one actually making the selection. If a selection is made by a non-resident agent, parent, subsidiary, affiliate, home office or branch office of a boycotting country resident, it is not a selection by a resident within the meaning of this exception.",
            "(10) A selection made solely by a bona fide resident and merely transmitted by another person to a United States person for execution is a selection by a bona fide resident within the meaning of this exception.",
            "(11) If a United States person receives, from another person located in the United States, what may be a unilateral selection by a boycotting country customer, and knows or has reason to know that the selection is made for boycott reasons, he has a duty to inquire of the transmitting person to determine who actually made the selection. If he knows or has reason to know that the selection was made by other than a boycotting country, or a national or resident of a boycotting country, he may not comply. A course or pattern of conduct which a United States person recognizes or should recognize as consistent with boycott restrictions will create a duty to inquire.",
            "(12) If the United States person does not know or have reason to know that the selection it receives is boycott-based, its compliance with such a selection does not offend any prohibition and this exception is not needed.",
            "(13) This exception applies only to compliance with selections of certain types of suppliers of services-carriers, insurers, and suppliers of services to be performed \u201cwithin the boycotting country.\u201d Services to be performed wholly within the United States or wholly within any country other than the boycotting country are not covered.",
            "(14) For purposes of this part, services are to be performed \u201cwithin the boycotting country\u201d only if they are of a type which would customarily be performed by suppliers of those services within the country of the recipient of those services, and if the part of the services performed within the boycotting country is a necessary and not insignificant part of the total services performed.",
            "(15) What is \u201ccustomary and necessary\u201d for these purposes depends on the usual practice of the supplier of the services (or the industry of which he is a part) as measured by the practice in non-boycotting as well as boycotting countries, except where such practices are instituted to accommodate this part.",
            "(16) This exception applies only to compliance with selections of certain types of goods\u2014goods that, in the normal course of business, are identifiable as to their source or origin at the time of their entry into the boycotting country. The definition of \u201cspecifically identifiable goods\u201d is the same under this section as it is in paragraph (g) of this section on \u201cCompliance with Local Law.\u201d",
            "(17) Goods \u201cspecifically identifiable\u201d in the normal course of business are those items which at the time of their entry into a boycotting country are identifiable as to source or origin by uniqueness of design or appearance; or trademark, trade name, or other identification normally on the items themselves, including their packaging. Goods are \u201cspecifically identifiable\u201d in the normal course of business if their source or origin is ascertainable by inspection of the items themselves, including their packaging, regardless of whether inspection takes place. Goods are not considered to be \u201cspecifically identifiable\u201d in the normal course of business if a trademark, trade name, or other form of identification not normally present is added to the items themselves, including their packaging, to accommodate this part.",
            "(18) If a unilateral selection meets the conditions described in paragraph (d) of this section, the United States person receiving the unilateral selection may comply or agree to comply, even if he knows or has reason to know that the selection was boycott-based. However, no United States person may comply or agree to comply with any unilateral selection if he knows or has reason to know that the purpose of the selection is to effect discrimination against any United States person on the basis of race, religion, sex, or national origin.",
            "(e) Shipment and transshipment of exports pursuant to a boycotting country's requirements.",
            "(1) A United States person may comply or agree to comply with the export requirements of a boycotting country with respect to shipments or transshipments of exports to:",
            "(i) A boycotted country;",
            "(ii) Any business concern of a boycotted country;",
            "(iii) Any business concern organized under the laws of a boycotted country; or",
            "(iv) Any national or resident of a boycotted country.",
            "(2) This exception permits compliance with restrictions which a boycotting country may place on direct exports to a boycotted country; on indirect exports to a boycotted country (i.e., those that pass via third parties); and on exports to residents, nationals, or business concerns of, or organized under the laws of, a boycotted country, including those located in third countries.",
            "(3) This exception also permits compliance with restrictions which a boycotting country may place on the route of export shipments when the restrictions are reasonably related to preventing the export shipments from coming into contact with or under the jurisdiction of the boycotted country. This exception applies whether a boycotting country or the vendor of the shipment:",
            "(i) Explicitly states that the shipment should not pass through the boycotted country enroute to its final destination; or",
            "(ii) Affirmatively describes a route of shipment that does not include the boycotted country.",
            "(4) A United States person may not, under this exception, refuse on an across-the-board basis to do business with a boycotted country or a national or resident of a boycotted country.",
            "(f) Immigration, passport, visa, or employment requirements of a boycotting country.",
            "(1) A United States individual may comply or agree to comply with the immigration, passport, visa, or employment requirements of a boycotting country, and with requests for information from a boycotting country made to ascertain whether such individual meets requirements for employment within the boycotting country, provided that he furnishes information only about himself or a member of his family, and not about any other United States individual, including his employees, employers, or co-workers.",
            "(2) For purposes of this section, a United States individual means a person who is a resident or national of the United States. Family means immediate family members, including parents, siblings, spouse, children, and other dependents living in the individual's home.",
            "(3) A United States person may not furnish information about its employees or executives, but may allow any individual to respond on his own to any request for information relating to immigration, passport, visa, or employment requirements. A United States person may also perform any ministerial acts to expedite processing of applications by individuals. These include informing employees of boycotting country visa requirements at an appropriate time; typing, translation, messenger and similar services; and assisting in or arranging for the expeditious processing of applications. All such actions must be undertaken on a non-discriminatory basis.",
            "(4) A United States person may proceed with a project in a boycotting country even if certain of its employees or other prospective participants in a transaction are denied entry for boycott reasons. But no employees or other participants may be selected in advance in a manner designed to comply with a boycott.",
            "(g) Compliance with local law. (1) This exception contains two parts. The first covers compliance with local law with respect to a United States person's activities exclusively within a foreign country; the second covers compliance with local import laws by United States persons resident in a foreign country. Under both parts of this exception, local laws are laws of the host country, whether derived from statutes, regulations, decrees, or other official sources having the effect of law in the host country. This exception is not available for compliance with presumed policies or understandings of policies unless those policies are reflected in official sources having the effect of law.",
            "(2) Both parts of this exception apply only to United States persons resident in a foreign country. For purposes of this exception, a United States person will be considered to be a resident of a foreign country only if he is a bona fide resident. A United States person may be a bona fide resident of a foreign country even if such person's residency is temporary.",
            "(3)(i) Factors that will be considered in determining whether a United States person is a bona fide resident of a foreign country include:",
            "(A) Physical presence in the country;",
            "(B) Whether residence is needed for legitimate business reasons;",
            "(C) Continuity of the residency;",
            "(D) Intent to maintain the residency;",
            "(E) Prior residence in the country;",
            "(F) Size and nature of presence in the country;",
            "(G) Whether the person is registered to do business or incorporated in the country;",
            "(H) Whether the person has a valid work visa; and",
            "(I) Whether the person has a similar presence in both boycotting and non-boycotting foreign countries in connection with similar business activities.",
            "(ii) No one of the factors in paragraph (g)(3) of this section is dispositive. All the circumstances involved will be closely examined to ascertain whether there is, in fact, bona fide residency. Residency established solely for purposes of avoidance of the application of this part, unrelated to legitimate business needs, does not constitute bona fide residency.",
            "(h) Activities exclusively within a foreign country. (1) Any United States person who is a bona fide resident of a foreign country, including a boycotting country, may comply or agree to comply with the laws of that country with respect to his activities exclusively within that country. These activities include:",
            "(i) Entering into contracts which provide that local law applies or governs, or that the parties will comply with such laws;",
            "(ii) Employing residents of the host country;",
            "(iii) Retaining local contractors to perform work within the host country;",
            "(iv) Purchasing or selling goods or services from or to residents of the host country; and",
            "(v) Furnishing information within the host country.",
            "(2) Activities exclusively within the country do not include importing goods or services from outside the host country, and, therefore, this part of the exception does not apply to compliance with import laws in connection with importing goods or services.",
            "(i) Compliance with local import law. (1) Any United States person who is a bona fide resident of a foreign country, including a boycotting country, may, in importing goods, materials or components into that country, comply or agree to comply with the import laws of that country, provided that:",
            "(i) The items are for his own use or for his use in performing contractual services within that country; and",
            "(ii) In the normal course of business, the items are identifiable as to their source or origin at the time of their entry into the foreign country by:",
            "(a) Uniqueness of design or appearance; or",
            "(b) Trademark, trade name, or other identification normally on the items themselves, including their packaging.",
            "(2) The factors that will be considered in determining whether a United States person is a bona fide resident of a foreign country are those set forth in paragraph (g) of this section. Bona fide residence of a United States company's subsidiary, affiliate, or other permanent establishment in a foreign country does not confer such residence on such United States company. Likewise, bona fide residence of a United States company's employee in a foreign country does not confer such residence on the entire company.",
            "(3) A United States person who is a bona fide resident of a foreign country may take action under this exception through an agent outside the country, but the agent must act at the direction of the resident and not exercise his own discretion. Therefore, if a United States person resident in a boycotting country takes action to comply with a boycotting country's import law with respect to the importation of qualified goods, he may direct his agent in the United States on the action to be taken, but the United States agent himself may not exercise any discretion.",
            "(4) For purposes of this exception, the test that governs whether goods or components of goods are specifically identifiable is identical to the test applied in paragraph (d) of this section on \u201cCompliance With Unilateral and Specific Selection\u201d to determine whether they are identifiable as to their source or origin in the normal course of business.",
            "(5) The availability of this exception for the import of goods depends on whether the goods are intended for the United States person's own use at the time they are imported. It does not depend upon who has title to the goods at the time of importation into a foreign country.",
            "(6) Goods are for the United States person's own use (including the performance of contractual services within the foreign country) if:",
            "(i) They are to be consumed by the United States person;",
            "(ii) They are to remain in the United States person's possession and to be used by that person;",
            "(iii) They are to be used by the United States person in performing contractual services for another;",
            "(iv) They are to be further manufactured, incorporated into, refined into, or reprocessed into another product to be manufactured for another; or",
            "(v) They are to be incorporated into, or permanently affixed as a functional part of, a project to be constructed for another.",
            "(7) Goods acquired to fill an order for such goods from another are not for the United States person's own use. Goods procured for another are not for one's own use, even if the furnishing of procurement services is the business in which the United States person is customarily engaged. Nor are goods obtained for simple resale acquired for one's own use, even if the United States person is engaged in the retail business. Likewise, goods obtained for inclusion in a turnkey project are not for one's own use if they are not customarily incorporated into, or do not customarily become permanently affixed as a functional part of the project.",
            "(8) This part of the local law exception does not apply to the import of services, even when the United States person importing such services is a bona fide resident of a boycotting country and is importing them for his own use. In addition, this exception is available for a United States person who is a bona fide resident of a foreign country only when the individual or entity actually present within that country takes action through the exercise of his own discretion.",
            "(9) Use of this exception will be monitored and continually reviewed to determine whether its continued availability is consistent with the national interest. Its availability may be limited or withdrawn as appropriate. In reviewing the continued availability of this exception, the effect that the inability to comply with local import laws would have on the economic and other relations of the United States with boycotting countries will be considered.",
            "(10) A United States person who is a bona fide resident of a foreign country may comply or agree to comply with the host country's import laws even if he knows or has reason to know that particular laws are boycott-related. However, no United States person may comply or agree to comply with any host country law which would require him to discriminate against any United States person on the basis of race, religion, sex, or national origin, or to supply information about any United States person's race, religion, sex, or national origin."

            "(b) The exceptions set forth in \u00a7 760.3(a) through (i) do not permit activities or agreements (express or implied by a course of conduct, including a pattern of responses) which are otherwise prohibited by this part and which are not within the intent of such exceptions.

            "(c) Use of any artifice, device or scheme which is intended to place a person at a commercial disadvantage or impose on him special burdens because he is blacklisted or otherwise restricted for boycott reasons from having a business relationship with or in a boycotting country will be regarded as evasion for purposes of this part.",
            "(d) Unless permitted under one of the exceptions, use of risk of loss provisions that expressly impose a financial risk on another because of the import laws of a boycotting country may constitute evasion. If they are introduced after January 18, 1978, their use will be presumed to constitute evasion. This presumption may be rebutted by a showing that such a provision is in customary usage without distinction between boycotting and non-boycotting countries and that there is a legitimate non-boycott reason for its use. On the other hand, use of such a provision by a United States person subsequent to January 18, 1978 is presumed not to constitute evasion if the provision had been customarily used by that person prior to January 18, 1978.",
            "(e) Use of dummy corporations or other devices to mask prohibited activity will also be regarded as evasion. Similarly, it is evasion under this part to divert specific boycotting country orders from a United States parent to a foreign subsidiary for purposes of complying with prohibited boycott requirements. However, alteration of a person's structure or method of doing business will not constitute evasion so long as the alteration is based on legitimate business considerations and is not undertaken solely to avoid the application of the prohibitions of this part. The facts and circumstances of an arrangement or transaction will be carefully scrutinized to see whether appearances conform to reality."

          "heading": "\u00a7 760.5   Reporting requirements.",
          "paragraphs": [
            "(a) Scope of reporting requirements. (1) A United States person who receives a request to take any action which has the effect of furthering or supporting a restrictive trade practice or boycott fostered or imposed by a foreign country against a country friendly to the United States or against any United States person must report such request to the Department of Commerce in accordance with the requirements of this section. Such a request may be either written or oral and may include a request to furnish information or enter into or implement an agreement. It may also include a solicitation, directive, legend or instruction that asks for information or that asks that a United States person take or refrain from taking a particular action. Such a request shall be reported regardless of whether the action requested is prohibited or permissible under this part, except as otherwise provided by this section.",
            "(2) For purposes of this section, a request received by a United States person is reportable if he knows or has reason to know that the purpose of the request is to enforce, implement, or otherwise further, support, or secure compliance with an unsanctioned foreign boycott or restrictive trade practice.",
            "(i) A request received by a United States person located in the United States is reportable if it is received in connection with a transaction or activity in the interstate or foreign commerce of the United States, as determined under \u00a7 760.1(d)(1) through (5) and (18) of this part.",
            "(ii) A request received by a United States person located outside the United States (that is, a foreign subsidiary, partnership, affiliate, branch, office, or other permanent foreign establishment which is controlled in fact by any domestic concern, as determined under \u00a7 760.1(c) of this part) is reportable if it is received in connection with a transaction or activity in the interstate or foreign commerce of the United States, as determined under \u00a7 760.1(d)(6) through (17) and (19) of this part.",
            "(iii) A request such as a boycott questionnaire, unrelated to a particular transaction or activity, received by any United States person is reportable when such person has or anticipates a business relationship with or in a boycotting country involving the sale, purchase or transfer of goods or services (including information) in the interstate or foreign commerce of the United States, as determined under \u00a7 760.1(d) of this part.",
            "(3) These reporting requirements apply to all United States persons. They apply whether the United States person receiving the request is an exporter, bank or other financial institution, insurer, freight forwarder, manufacturer, or any other United States person subject to this part.",
            "(4) The acquisition of information about a boycotting country's boycott requirements through the receipt or review of books, pamphlets, legal texts, exporters' guidebooks and other similar publications does not constitute receipt of a reportable request for purposes of this section. In addition, a United States person who receives an unsolicited invitation to bid, or similar proposal, containing a boycott request has not received a reportable request for purposes of this section where he does not respond to the invitation to bid or other proposal.",
            "(5) Because of the use of certain terms for boycott and non-boycott purposes; because of Congressional mandates to provide clear and precise guidelines in areas of inherent uncertainty; and because of the Department's commitment to minimize paperwork and reduce the cost of reporting where it will not impair the Department's ability to continue to monitor foreign boycotts, the following specific requests are not reportable:",
            "(i) A request to refrain from shipping goods on a carrier which flies the flag of a particular country or which is owned, chartered, leased or operated by a particular country or by nationals or residents of a particular country, or a request to certify to that effect.",
            "(ii) A request to ship goods via a prescribed route, or a request to refrain from shipping goods via a proscribed route, or a request to certify to either effect.",
            "(iii) A request to supply an affirmative statement or certification regarding the country of origin of goods.",
            "(iv) A request to supply an affirmative statement or certification regarding the name of the supplier or manufacturer of the goods shipped or the name of the provider of services.",
            "(v) A request to comply with the laws of another country except where the request expressly requires compliance with that country's boycott laws.",
            "(vi) A request to an individual to supply information about himself or a member of his family for immigration, passport, visa, or employment purposes.",
            "(vii) A request to supply an affirmative statement or certification indicating the destination of exports or confirming or otherwise indicating that such cargo will be unloaded or discharged at a particular destination.",
            "(viii) A request to supply a certificate by the owner, master, charterer, or any employee thereof, that a vessel, aircraft, truck or any other mode of transportation is eligible, otherwise eligible, permitted, or allowed to enter, or not restricted from entering, a particular port, country, or group of countries pursuant to the laws, rules, or regulations of that port, country, or group of countries.",
            "(ix) A request to supply a certificate from an insurance company stating that the insurance company has a duly authorized agent or representative within a boycotting country and/or the name and address of such agent.",
            "(x) A request to comply with a term or condition of a transaction that provides that the vendor bear the risk of loss and indemnify the purchaser if the vendor's goods are denied entry into a country for any reason (\u201crisk of loss clause\u201d) if such clause was in use by the purchaser prior to January 18, 1978.",
            "(6) No United States person may engage in any transaction or take any other action, either independently or through any other person, with intent to evade the provisions of this part.",
            "(7) From time to time the Department will survey domestic concerns for purposes of determining the worldwide scope of boycott requests received by their controlled foreign subsidiaries and affiliates with respect to their activities outside United States commerce. This pertains to requests which would be reportable under this section but for the fact that the activities to which the requests relate are outside United States commerce. The information requested will include the number and nature of non-reportable boycott requests received, the action(s) requested, the actions(s) taken in response and the countries in which the requests originate. The results of such surveys, including the names of those surveyed, will be made public.",
            "(b) Manner of reporting. (1) Each reportable request must be reported. However, if more than one document (such as an invitation to bid, purchase order, or letter of credit) containing the same boycott request is received as part of the same transaction, only the first such request need be reported. Individual shipments against the same purchase order or letter of credit are to be treated as part of the same transaction. Each different boycott request associated with a given transaction must be reported, regardless of how or when the request is received.",
            "(2) Each United States person actually receiving a reportable request must report that request. However, such person may designate someone else to report on his behalf. For example, a United States company, if authorized, may report on behalf of its controlled foreign subsidiary or affiliates; a freight forwarder, if authorized, may report on behalf of the exporter; and a bank, if authorized, may report on behalf of the beneficiary of a letter of credit. If a person designated to report a request received by another receives an identical request directed to him in connection with the same transaction, he may file one report on behalf of himself and the other person.",
            "(3) Where a person is designated to report on behalf of another, the person receiving the request remains liable for any failure to report or for any representations made on his behalf. Further, anyone reporting on behalf of another is not relieved of his own responsibility for reporting any boycott request which he receives, even if it is an identical request in connection with the same transaction.",
            "(4) Reports may be submitted by mail or electronically. Mailed paper reports must be submitted in duplicate to: Report Processing Staff, Office of Antiboycott Compliance, U.S. Department of Commerce, Room 6098, Washington, DC 20230. Electronic reports must be submitted in duplicate, by following the prompts on the screen, through the Office of Antiboycott Compliance Web page of the BIS Web site, http://bis.doc.gov/index.php/enforcement/oac?id=300. Each submission, whether paper or electronic, must be made in accordance with the following requirements:",
            "(i) Where the person receiving the request is a United States person located in the United States, each report of requests must be postmarked or electronically date-stamped by the last day of the month following the calendar quarter in which the request was received (e.g., April 30 for the quarter consisting of January, February, and March).",
            "(ii) Where the person receiving the request is a United States person located outside the United States, each report of requests must be postmarked or electronically date-stamped by the last day of the second month following the calendar quarter in which the request was received (e.g., May 31 for the quarter consisting of January, February, and March).",
            "(5) Mailed paper reports may, at the reporting person's option, be submitted on either a single transaction form (Form BIS-621P, Report of Request for Restrictive Trade Practice or Boycott, Single Transaction, (revised 10-89)) or on a multiple transaction form (Form BIS-6051P, Report of Request for Restrictive Trade Practice or Boycott, Multiple Transactions, (revised 10-89)). Electronic reports may be submitted only on the single transaction form, which will electronically reproduce the reporting person's identifying information to facilitate reporting of multiple transactions.",
            "(6) Reports, whether submitted on the paper single transaction form or on the paper multiple transaction form, or submitted electronically, must contain entries for every applicable item on the form, including whether the reporting person intends to take or has taken the action requested. If the reporting person has not decided what action he will take by the time the report is required to be filed, he must later report the action he decides to take within 10 business days after deciding. In addition, anyone filing a report on behalf of another must so indicate and identify that other person.",
            "(7) Each report of a boycott request, whether submitted by mail or electronically, must be accompanied by two copies of the relevant page(s) of any document(s) in which the request appears (see, paragraph (c)(2) of this section). For mail submissions, the relevant pages shall be attached in paper format to the report form; for electronic submissions, the relevant pages shall be attached in PDF format to the electronic submission. Reports, whether paper or electronic, may also be accompanied by any additional information relating to the request as the reporting person desires to provide concerning his response to the request. For electronic submissions, such additional information should be provided as a PDF attachment.",
            "(8) Records containing information relating to a reportable boycott request, including a copy of any document(s) in which the request appears, must be maintained by the recipient for a five-year period after receipt of the request. The Department may require that these materials be submitted to it or that it have access to them at any time within that period. (See part 762 of the EAR for additional recordkeeping requirements.)",
            "(c) Disclosure of information. (1) Reports of requests received on or after October 7, 1976, as well as any accompanying documents filed with the reports, have been and will continue to be made available for public inspection and copying, except for certain proprietary information. With respect to reports of requests received on or after August 1, 1978, if the person making the report certifies that a United States person to whom the report relates would be placed at a competitive disadvantage because of the disclosure of information regarding the quantity, description, or value of any articles, materials, and supplies, including related technical data and other information, whether contained in a report or in any accompanying document(s), such information will not be publicly disclosed except upon failure by the reporting entity to edit the public inspection copy of the accompanying document(s) as provided by paragraph (c)(2) of this section, unless the Secretary of Commerce determines that the disclosure would not place the United States person involved at a competitive disadvantage or that it would be contrary to the national interest to withhold the information. In the event the Secretary of Commerce considers making such a determination concerning competitive disadvantage, appropriate notice and an opportunity for comment will be given before any such proprietary information is publicly disclosed. In no event will requests of reporting persons to withhold any information contained in the report other than that specified in this paragraph be honored.",
            "(2) Because a copy of any document(s) accompanying the report will be made available for public inspection and copying, one copy must be submitted intact and another copy must be edited by the reporting entity to delete the same information which it certified in the report would place a United States person at a competitive disadvantage if disclosed. In addition, the reporting entity may delete from this copy information that is considered confidential and that is not required to be contained in the report (e.g., information related to foreign consignee). This copy should be conspicuously marked with the legend \u201cPublic Inspection Copy.\u201d With respect to documents accompanying reports received by the Department on or after July 1, 1979, the public inspection copy will be made available as submitted whether or not it has been appropriately edited by the reporting entity as provided by this paragraph.",
            "(3) Reports and accompanying documents which are available to the public for inspection and copying are located in the BIS Freedom of Information Records Inspection Facility, Room 4525, Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20230. Requests to inspect such documents should be addressed to that facility.",
            "(4) The Secretary of Commerce will periodically transmit summaries of the information contained in the reports to the Secretary of State for such action as the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, may deem appropriate for carrying out the policies in section 8(b)(2) of the Export Administration Act of 1979."

            "(a) General policy. BIS strongly encourages disclosure to the Office of Export Enforcement (OEE) if you believe that you may have violated the EAR, or any order, license or authorization issued thereunder. As described in supplement no. 1 to part 766, voluntary self-disclosure is a mitigating factor, and a firm's deliberate decision not to disclose significant apparent violations is an aggravating factor in determining what administrative sanctions, if any, will be sought by OEE. A deliberate decision not to disclose occurs when a firm uncovers a significant apparent violation that it has committed but then chooses not to file a VSD.",
            "(b) Limitations. (1) The provisions of this section do not apply to disclosures of violations relating to part 760 of the EAR.",
            "(2) The provisions of this section apply only when information is provided to OEE for its review in determining whether to take administrative action under part 766 of the EAR for violations of the export control provisions of the EAR.",
            "(3) The provisions of this section apply only when information is received by OEE for review prior to the time that OEE, or any other agency of the United States Government, has learned the same or substantially similar information from another source and has commenced an investigation or inquiry in connection with that information.",
            "(4) While voluntary self-disclosure is a mitigating factor in determining what administrative sanctions, if any, will be sought by OEE, it is a factor that is considered together with all other factors in a case. The weight given to voluntary self-disclosure is solely within the discretion of OEE, and the mitigating effect of voluntary self-disclosure may be outweighed by aggravating factors. Voluntary self-disclosure does not prevent transactions from being referred to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution. In such a case, OEE would notify the Department of Justice of the voluntary self-disclosure, but the consideration of that factor is within the discretion of the Department of Justice.",
            "(5) A firm will not be deemed to have made a disclosure under this section unless the individual making the disclosure did so with the full knowledge and authorization of the firm's senior management.",
            "(6) The provisions of this section do not, nor should they be relied on to, create, confer, or grant any rights, benefits, privileges, or protection enforceable at law or in equity by any person, business, or entity in any civil, criminal, administrative, or other matter.",
            "(c) Voluntary self-disclosures involving minor or technical violations\u2014(1) General. Any person wanting to voluntarily disclose a minor or technical violation should submit an abbreviated narrative report, as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. A minor or technical violation is one that does not contain any aggravating factors present as defined in section III(A) of supplement no. 1 to part 766. Examples of minor or technical violations include, but are not limited to, immaterial Electronic Export Information (EEI) filing errors, inadvertent record keeping violations resulting from failed file retrieval or retention mechanisms (e.g., physical damage caused by flood or fire and/or electronic corruption due to malware, virus, or outage), incorrect use of one license exception where other license exceptions were available, etc.",
            "(2) Abbreviated narrative report. The abbreviated narrative report should be submitted by email to bis_vsd_intake@bis.doc.gov or in writing to the address in paragraph (d)(7) of this section. The email subject line should include the word \u201cabbreviated\u201d if it is an abbreviated VSD.:",

            "(B) A description of the general nature and extent of the violations (including, but not limited to, the destination and parties involved in any transaction, and the number, classification, and value of any items involved). Parties may itemize the various minor or technical violations in list or spreadsheet form.",

            "(3) Bundling of minor/technical violations. Parties may bundle multiple minor or technical violations into one overarching submission, if the violations occurred within the preceding quarter. Parties may submit such minor or technical violations into a single VSD submission on a quarterly basis using the abbreviated narrative account process identified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.",
            "(d) Voluntary self-disclosures involving significant violations\u2014(1) General. Any person wanting to voluntarily disclose a significant violation should, in the manner outlined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, initially notify OEE as soon as possible after violations are discovered, and then conduct a thorough review of all export-related transactions where violations are suspected. A significant violation is one that involves one or more aggravating factors as defined in section III(A) of supplement no. 1 to part 766. Those unsure of whether their possible disclosure relates to a minor or technical violation, or a significant violation, should follow the procedure in paragraph (d)(2) of this section for a significant violation.",
            "(2) Initial notification\u2014(i) Manner and content of initial notification. The initial notification should be submitted by email to bis_vsd_intake@bis.doc.gov or in writing to the address in paragraph (d)(7) of this section. The notification should include the name of the person making the disclosure and a brief description of the suspected violations and should designate a contact person regarding the initial notification and provide that contact person's current business street address, email address, and telephone number. The notification should describe the general nature and extent of the violations. OEE recognizes that there may be situations where it will not be practical to make an initial notification in writing. For example, written notification may not be practical if a shipment leaves the United States without the required license, yet there is still an opportunity to prevent acquisition of the items by unauthorized persons. In such situations, OEE should be contacted promptly at the office listed in paragraph (d)(7) of this section.",
            "(ii) Initial notification date. For purposes of calculating when a complete narrative account must be submitted under paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section, the initial notification date is the date the notification is received by OEE. OEE will notify the disclosing party in writing of the date that it receives the initial notification. At OEE's discretion, such writing from OEE may be on paper, or in an email message or facsimile transmission from OEE, or by any other method for the transmission of written communications. Where it is not practical to make an initial notification in writing, the person making the notification should confirm the oral notification in writing as soon as possible.",
            "(iii) Timely completion of narrative accounts. The full narrative account required by paragraph (d)(3) of this section must be received by OEE within 180 days of the initial notification date for purposes of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, absent an extension from the Director of OEE. If the person making the initial notification subsequently completes and submits to OEE the narrative account required by paragraph (d)(3) of this section such that OEE receives it within 180 days of the initial notification date, or within the additional time, if any, granted by the Director of OEE pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this section, the disclosure, including violations disclosed in the narrative account that were not expressly mentioned in the initial notification, will be deemed to have been made on the initial notification date for purposes of paragraph (b)(3) of this section if the initial notification was made in compliance with paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section. Failure to meet the deadline (either the initial 180-day deadline or an extended deadline granted by the Director of OEE) would not be an additional violation of the EAR, but such failure may reduce or eliminate the mitigating impact of the voluntary disclosure under supplement no. 1 to this part. For purposes of determining whether the deadline has been met under this paragraph, a complete narrative account must contain all of the pertinent information called for in paragraphs (d)(3) through (5) of this section, and the voluntary self-disclosure must otherwise meet the requirements of this section.",
            "(iv) Deadline extensions. The Director of OEE may extend the 180-day deadline upon a determination in his or her discretion that U.S. Government interests would be served by an extension or that the person making the initial notification has shown that more than 180 days is reasonably needed to complete the narrative account.",
            "(A) Conditions for extension. The Director of OEE in his or her discretion may place conditions on the approval of an extension. For example, the Director of OEE may require that the disclosing person agree to toll the statute of limitations with respect to violations disclosed in the initial notification or discovered during the review for or preparation of the narrative account, and/or require the disclosing person to undertake specified interim remedial compliance measures.",
            "(B) Contents of request. (1) In most instances 180 days should be adequate to complete the narrative account. Requests to extend the 180-day deadline set forth in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section will be determined by the Director of OEE pursuant to his or her authority under this paragraph (d)(2)(iv) based upon his consideration and evaluation of U.S. Government interests and the facts and circumstances surrounding the request and any related investigations. Such requests should show specifically that the person making the request:",
            "(i) Began its review promptly after discovery of the violations;",
            "(ii) Has been conducting its review and preparation of the narrative account as expeditiously as can be expected, consistent with the need for completeness and accuracy;",
            "(iii) Reasonably needs the requested extension despite having begun its review promptly after discovery of the violations and having conducted its review and preparation of the narrative account as expeditiously as can be expected consistent with the need for completeness and accuracy; and",
            "(iv) Has considered whether interim compliance or other corrective measures may be needed and has undertaken such measures as appropriate to prevent recurring or additional violations.",
            "(2) Such requests also should set out a proposed timeline for completion and submission of the narrative account that is reasonable under the applicable facts and circumstances and should also designate a contact person regarding the request and provide that contact person's current business street address, email address, and telephone number. Requests may also include additional information that the person making the request reasonably believes is pertinent to the request under the applicable facts and circumstances.",
            "(C) Timing of requests. Requests for an extension should be made before the 180-day deadline and as soon as possible once a disclosing person determines that it will be unable to meet the deadline or the extended deadline where an extension previously has been granted, and possesses the information needed to prepare an extension request in accordance with paragraph (d)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. Requests for extension that are not received before the deadline for completing the narrative account has passed will not be considered. Parties who request an extension shortly before the deadline incur the risk that the Director of OEE will be unable to consider the request, determine whether or not to grant the extension, and communicate his or her decision before the deadline, and that any subsequently submitted narrative account will be considered untimely under paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section.",
            "(3) Full narrative. After the initial notification, a thorough review should be conducted of export-related transactions where violations with potentially aggravating factors are suspected (as defined in section III(A) of supplement no. 1 to part 766). OEE recommends that the review cover a period of five years prior to the date of the initial notification. If your review goes back less than five years, you risk failing to discover violations that may later become the subject of an investigation. Any violations not voluntarily disclosed do not receive consideration under this section. However, the failure to make such disclosures will not be treated as a separate violation unless some other section of the EAR or other provision of law requires disclosure. Upon completion of the review, OEE should be furnished with a narrative account that sufficiently describes the suspected violations so that their nature and gravity can be assessed. The narrative account should also describe the nature of the review conducted and measures that may have been taken to minimize the likelihood that violations will occur in the future. The narrative account should include:",
            "(i) The kind of violation involved, for example, a shipment without the required license or dealing with a party denied export privileges;",
            "(ii) An explanation of when and how the violations occurred;",
            "(iii) The complete identities and addresses of all individuals and organizations, whether foreign or domestic, involved in the activities giving rise to the violations;",
            "(iv) License numbers;",
            "(v) The description, quantity, value in U.S. dollars and ECCN or other classification of the items involved; and",
            "(vi) A description of any mitigating circumstances.",
            "(4) Supporting documentation. (i) The narrative account should be accompanied by copies of documents that explain and support it, including:",
            "(A) Licensing documents such as licenses, license applications, import certificates and end-user statements;",
            "(B) Shipping documents such as Shipper's Export Declarations, air waybills, bills of lading and packing lists; and",
            "(C) Other documents such as letters, facsimiles, telexes and other evidence of written or oral communications, internal memoranda, purchase orders, invoices, letters of credit and brochures.",
            "(ii) Any relevant documents not attached to the narrative account must be retained by the person making the disclosure until OEE requests them, or until a final decision on the disclosed information has been made. After a final decision, the documents should be maintained in accordance with the recordkeeping rules in part 762 of the EAR (15 CFR part 762).",
            "(5) Certification. A certification must be submitted stating that all of the representations made in connection with the voluntary self-disclosure are true and correct to the best of that person's knowledge and belief. Certifications made by a corporation or other organization should be signed by an official of the corporation or other organization with the authority to do so. \u00a7 764.2(g), relating to false or misleading representations, applies in connection with the disclosure of information under this section.",
            "(6) Oral presentations. OEE believes that oral presentations are generally not necessary to augment the written narrative account and supporting documentation. If the person making the disclosure believes otherwise, a request for a meeting should be included with the disclosure.",
            "(7) Where to make voluntary self-disclosures. The information constituting a voluntary self-disclosure or any other correspondence pertaining to a voluntary self-disclosure may be submitted by email to bis_vsd_intake@bis.doc.gov or mailed to: Director, Office of Export Enforcement, 1401 Constitution Ave., Room H4514, Washington, DC 20230, Tel: (202) 482-5036.",
            "(e) Dual-track processing of Voluntary Self-Disclosures by the Office of Export Enforcement. (1) For VSDs that involve minor or technical infractions, including abbreviated VSDs, OEE will generally resolve the VSD within 60 days of a final VSD submission with one of the actions in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section.",
            "(i) Inform the person making the disclosure that, based on the facts disclosed, it plans to take no action; or",
            "(ii) Issue a warning letter.",
            "(2) For VSDs that indicate significant violations, OEE will conduct an investigation, and as quickly as the facts and circumstances of a given case permit, OEE may take any of the following actions:",
            "(i) Inform the person making the disclosure that, based on the facts disclosed, it plans to take no action;",
            "(ii) Issue a warning letter;",
            "(iii) Issue a proposed charging letter pursuant to \u00a7 766.18 of the EAR and attempt to settle the matter;",
            "(iv) Issue a charging letter pursuant to \u00a7 766.3 of the EAR if a settlement is not reached; and/or",
            "(v) Refer the matter to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution.",
            "(f) Criteria. Supplement no. 1 to part 766 describes how BIS typically exercises its discretion regarding whether to pursue an administrative enforcement case under part 766 and what administrative sanctions to seek in settling such a case.",
            "(g) Treatment of unlawfully exported items. (1) Any person taking certain actions with knowledge that a violation of ECRA or the EAR has occurred has violated \u00a7 764.2(e).",
            "(i) Any person who has made a voluntary self-disclosure knows that a violation may have occurred. Therefore, at the time that a voluntary self-disclosure is made, the person making the disclosure may request permission from BIS to engage in the activities described in \u00a7 764.2(e) that would otherwise be prohibited.",
            "(ii) Any person may also notify the Director of OEE that a violation has occurred and request permission from BIS to engage in the activities described in \u00a7 764.2(e) that would otherwise be prohibited.",
            "(iii) Actions to return to the United States an item that has been unlawfully exported and disclosed under this section only require notification to the Director of OEE. Items subject to a violation that have been returned to the United States do not require further authorization under this paragraph (g) for future activities, provided that those future activities comply with any applicable EAR requirements.",
            "(2) How to submit a request under paragraphs (g)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section: A request should be submitted on letterhead, signed, and sent to the Director of the Office of Exporter",
            "(3) If a request submitted pursuant to paragraph (g)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section is granted by the Office of Exporter Services in consultation with OEE, future activities with respect to those items that would otherwise violate \u00a7 764.2(e) will not constitute violations.",
            "(4) Reexports and transfers (in-country). To reexport or transfer (in-country) items that are the subject of a voluntary self-disclosure or notification, and that have been exported contrary to the provisions of ECRA or the EAR, authorization may be requested from BIS in accordance with the provisions of part 748 of the EAR (15 CFR part 748). If the applicant who submitted the reexport or transfer authorization knows that the items are the subject of a voluntary self-disclosure or notification, the request should state that a voluntary self-disclosure or notification was made in connection with the export of the items for which authorization is sought and a copy of the voluntary self-disclosure or notification should be included with the license application.",
            "(5) Automated Export System (AES) filing errors. Disclosures and notifications of AES filing errors reported to OEE under paragraphs (g)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section, where no other violation of the EAR only require notification to OEE and do not require authorization under this paragraph (g) to engage in activities subject to the EAR. The AES filing must be corrected with the Census Bureau before proceeding with such activities provided the activities meet any applicable EAR requirements. If another violation, such as failure to obtain a required license, has occurred in addition to the AES filing error, authorization under this paragraph (g) is required."

            "(a) Introduction. As set forth in \u00a7 764.2(e) of this part, and restated in General Prohibition Ten at \u00a7 736.2(b)(10) of the EAR, no person (including a non-U.S. Third Party) may order, buy, remove, conceal, store, use, sell, loan, dispose of, transfer, finance, forward, or otherwise service, in whole or in part, any item subject to the EAR with knowledge that a violation has occurred, or will occur, in connection with the item. This section addresses the application of \u00a7 764.2(e) of this part to activities involving items subject to the EAR that may have been illegally exported or reexported to Libya before the comprehensive embargo on Libya ended (April 29, 2004) (\u201cinstalled base\u201d items).",
            "(b) Libya\u2014(1) Activities involving installed base items in Libya for which no license is required. Subject to the reporting requirement set forth in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, activities within the scope of \u00a7 764.2(e) of this part involving installed base items described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section that are located in Libya and that were exported or reexported before April 29, 2004 do not require a license from BIS.",
            "(i) Scope. An installed base item is within the scope of paragraph (b)(1) of this section if:",
            "(A) It is not on the Commerce Control List in supplement no. 1 to part 774 of the EAR;",
            "(B) It is on the Commerce Control List, but is authorized for export or reexport pursuant to a License Exception to Libya; or",
            "(C) It is on the Commerce Control List and controlled only for AT reasons or for NS and AT reasons only, and is not listed on the Wassenaar Arrangement's Sensitive List (Annex 1) or Very Sensitive List (Annex 2) posted on the Wassenaar Arrangement's Web site (www.wassenaar.org) at the Control Lists web page.",
            "(ii) Reporting requirement. Any person engaging in activity described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section must submit to BIS's Office of Export Enforcement (OEE) a report including all known material facts with respect to how the installed base item arrived in Libya. The report must be submitted to OEE at the address identified in \u00a7 764.4(a) of the EAR within ninety (90) days of the first activity relating to the installed base item in Libya. A report may address more than one activity and/or more than one installed base item. An additional report must be submitted if any new material information regarding the export or reexport to Libya of the installed base item is discovered.",
            "(2) Licensing procedure for activities involving installed base items in Libya\u2014(i) License requirement. Any person seeking to undertake activities within the scope of \u00a7 764.2(e) of the EAR with respect to any installed base item located in Libya and not described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section must obtain a license from BIS prior to engaging in any such activities. License applications should be submitted in accordance with \u00a7\u00a7 748.1, 748.4 and 748.6 of the EAR, and should fully describe the relevant activity within the scope of \u00a7 764.2(e) of this part which is the basis of the application. License applications should include all known material facts as to how the installed base item originally was exported or reexported to Libya. This section also applies if you know that an item to be exported or reexported to a third party will be used on an installed base item not described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.",
            "(ii) Licensing policy. BIS will review license applications submitted pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section on a case-by-case basis. Favorable consideration will be given for those applications related to civil end-uses in Libya. Applications related to military, police, intelligence, or other sensitive end-uses in Libya will be subject to a general policy of denial.",
            "(3) Exclusion. The provisions of this section are not applicable to any activities within the scope of \u00a7 764.2(e) of the EAR undertaken with respect to an installed base item in Libya by a person who was party to the original illegal export or reexport of the related installed base item to Libya. Such persons should voluntarily self-disclose violations pursuant to the procedures set forth in \u00a7 764.5 of this part, which in some cases may allow activities related to unlawfully exported or reexported items to be undertaken based on permission from BIS.",
            "(4) Relationship to other Libya license requirements. Notwithstanding this section, a license may be required pursuant to another provision of the EAR to engage in activity involving Libya. If a license is required pursuant to another section of the EAR, and the transaction also involves activity within the scope of \u00a7 764.2(e) of this part related to an installed base item in Libya, this information should be specified on the license application. Such applications must also include all known information as to how the installed base item originally arrived in Libya. If granted, the license for the proposed transaction will also authorize the related activity within the scope of \u00a7 764.2(e) of this part."

            "This section sets forth procedures for disclosing violations of part 760 of the EAR\u2014Restrictive Trade Practices or Boycotts and violations of part 762\u2014Recordkeeping\u2014with respect to records related to part 760. In this section, these provisions are referred to collectively as the \u201cantiboycott provisions.\u201d This section also describes BIS's policy regarding such disclosures.",
            "(a) General policy. BIS strongly encourages disclosure to the Office of Antiboycott Compliance (OAC) if you believe that you may have violated the antiboycott provisions. Voluntary self-disclosures are a mitigating factor with respect to any enforcement action that OAC might take.",
            "(b) Limitations. (1) This section does not apply to disclosures of violations relating to provisions of the EAR other than the antiboycott provisions. Section 764.5 of this part describes how to prepare disclosures of violations of the EAR other than the antiboycott provisions.",
            "(2) The provisions of this section apply only when information is provided to OAC for its review in determining whether to take administrative action under parts 764 and 766 of the EAR for violations of the antiboycott provisions.",
            "(3) Timing. The provisions of this section apply only if OAC receives the voluntary self-disclosure as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section before it commences an investigation or inquiry in connection with the same or substantially similar information it received from another source.",
            "(i) Mandatory reports. For purposes of this section, OAC's receipt of a report required to be filed under \u00a7 760.5 of the EAR that discloses that a person took an action prohibited by part 760 of the EAR constitutes the receipt of information from another source.",
            "(ii) Requests for advice. For purposes of this section, a violation that is revealed to OAC by a person who is seeking advice, either by telephone or e-mail, about the antiboycott provisions does not constitute the receipt of information from another source. Such revelation also does not constitute a voluntary self-disclosure or initial notification of a voluntary self-disclosure for purposes of this section.",
            "(4) Although a voluntary self-disclosure is a mitigating factor in determining what administrative sanctions, if any, will be sought by BIS, it is a factor that is considered together with all other factors in a case. The weight given to voluntary self-disclosure is solely within the discretion of BIS, and the mitigating effect of voluntary self-disclosure may be outweighed by aggravating factors. Voluntary self-disclosure does not prevent transactions from being referred to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution. In such a case, BIS would notify the Department of Justice of the voluntary self-disclosure, but the decision as to how to consider that factor is within the discretion of the Department of Justice.",
            "(5) A firm will not be deemed to have made a disclosure under this section unless the individual making the disclosure did so with the full knowledge and authorization of the firm's senior management or of a person with authority to make such disclosures on behalf of the firm.",
            "(6) The provisions of this section do not, nor should they be relied on to, create, confer, or grant any rights, benefits, privileges, or protection enforceable at law or in equity by any person, business, or entity in any civil, criminal, administrative, or other matter.",
            "(c) Information to be provided\u2014(1) General. Any person wanting to disclose information that constitutes a voluntary self-disclosure should, in the manner outlined below, initially notify OAC as soon as possible after violations are discovered, and then conduct a thorough review of all transactions where violations of the antiboycott provisions are suspected.",
            "(2) Initial notification. The initial notification must be in writing and be sent to the address in \u00a7 764.8(c)(7) of this part. The notification should include the name of the person making the disclosure and a brief description of the suspected violations. The notification should describe the general nature and extent of the violations. If the person making the disclosure subsequently completes the narrative account required by \u00a7 764.8(c)(3) of this part, the disclosure will be deemed to have been made on the date of the initial notification for purposes of \u00a7 764.8(b)(3) of this part.",
            "(3) Narrative account. After the initial notification, a thorough review should be conducted of all business transactions where possible antiboycott provision violations are suspected. OAC recommends that the review cover a period of five years prior to the date of the initial notification. If your review goes back less than five years, you risk failing to discover violations that may later become the subject of an investigation. Any violations not voluntarily disclosed do not receive the same mitigation as the violations voluntarily self-disclosed under this section. However, the failure to make such disclosures will not be treated as a separate violation unless some other section of the EAR or other provision of law enforced by BIS requires disclosure. Upon completion of the review, OAC should be furnished with a narrative account that sufficiently describes the suspected violations so that their nature and gravity can be assessed. The narrative account should also describe the nature of the review conducted and measures that may have been taken to minimize the likelihood that violations will occur in the future. The narrative account should include:",
            "(i) The kind of violation involved, for example, the furnishing of a certificate indicating that the goods supplied did not originate in a boycotted country;",
            "(ii) An explanation of when and how the violations occurred, including a description of activities surrounding the violations (e.g., contract negotiations, sale of goods, implementation of letter of credit, bid solicitation);",
            "(iii) The complete identities and addresses of all individuals and organizations, whether foreign or domestic, involved in the activities giving rise to the violations; and",
            "(iv) A description of any mitigating factors.",
            "(4) Supporting documentation.",
            "(i) The narrative account should be accompanied by copies of documents that explain and support it, including:",
            "(A) Copies of boycott certifications and declarations relating to the violation, or copies of documents containing prohibited language or prohibited requests for information;",
            "(B) Other documents relating to the violation, such as letters, facsimiles, telexes and other evidence of written or oral communications, negotiations, internal memoranda, purchase orders, invoices, bid requests, letters of credit and brochures;",
            "(ii) Any relevant documents not attached to the narrative account must be retained by the person making the disclosure until the latest of the following: the documents are supplied to OAC; BIS informs the disclosing party that it will take no action; BIS issues a warning letter for the violation; BIS issues an order that constitutes the final agency action in the matter and all avenues for appeal are exhausted; or the documents are no longer required to be kept under part 762 of the EAR.",
            "(5) Certification. A certification must be submitted stating that all of the representations made in connection with the voluntary self-disclosure are true and correct to the best of that person's knowledge and belief. Certifications made by a corporation or other organization should be signed by an official of the corporation or other organization with the authority to do so. Section 764.2(g) of this part relating to false or misleading representations applies in connection with the disclosure of information under this section.",
            "(6) Oral presentations. OAC believes that oral presentations are generally not necessary to augment the written narrative account and supporting documentation. If the person making the disclosure believes otherwise, a request for a meeting should be included with the disclosure.",
            "(7) Where to make voluntary self-disclosures. The information constituting a voluntary self-disclosure or any other correspondence pertaining to a voluntary self-disclosure should be submitted to: Office of Antiboycott Compliance, 14th and Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Room 6098, Washington, DC 20230, tel: (202) 482-2381, facsimile: (202) 482-0913.",
            "(d) Action by the Office of Antiboycott Compliance. After OAC has been provided with the required narrative and supporting documentation, it will acknowledge the disclosure by letter, provide the person making the disclosure with a point of contact, and take whatever additional action, including further investigation, it deems appropriate. As quickly as the facts and circumstances of a given case permit, BIS may take any of the following actions:",
            "(1) Inform the person making the disclosure that, based on the facts disclosed, it plans to take no action;",
            "(2) Issue a warning letter;",
            "(3) Issue a proposed charging letter and attempt to settle the matter pursuant to \u00a7 766.18 of the EAR;",
            "(4) Issue a charging letter pursuant to \u00a7 766.3 of the EAR if a settlement is not reached or BIS otherwise deems appropriate; and/or",
            "(5) Refer the matter to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution.",
            "(e) Criteria. Supplement no. 2 to part 766 of the EAR describes how BIS typically exercises its discretion regarding whether to pursue an antiboycott administrative enforcement case under part 766 and what administrative sanctions to seek in settling such a case."

The service of a discovery request shall be made at least 20 days before the scheduled date of the hearing unless the administrative law judge specifies a shorter time period.

It is often necessary for BIS to receive and consider information and documents that are sensitive from the standpoint of national security, foreign policy, business confidentiality, or investigative concern, and that are to be protected against disclosure. Accordingly, and without limiting the discretion of the administrative law judge to give effect to any other applicable privilege, it is proper for the administrative law judge to limit discovery or introduction of evidence or to issue such protective or other orders as in the judge's judgment may be consistent with the objective of preventing undue disclosure of the sensitive documents or information. Where the administrative law judge determines that documents containing the sensitive matter need to be made available to a respondent to avoid prejudice, the judge may direct BIS to prepare an unclassified and nonsensitive summary or extract of the documents. The administrative law judge may compare the extract or summary with the original to ensure that it is supported by the source document and that it omits only so much as must remain classified or undisclosed. The summary or extract may be admitted as evidence in the record.",

If the administrative law judge determines that this procedure is unsatisfactory and that classified or otherwise sensitive matter must form part of the record in order to avoid prejudice to a party, the judge may provide the parties opportunity to make arrangements that permit a party or a representative to have access to such matter without compromising sensitive information. Such arrangements may include obtaining security clearances, obtaining a national interest determination under section 12(c) of the EAA, or giving counsel for a party access to sensitive information and documents subject to assurances against further disclosure, including a protective order, if necessary."

If the Assistant Secretary does not approve the proposal, he/she will notify the parties and the case will proceed to adjudication by the administrative law judge as though no settlement proposal had been made.",
            "(2) If the case is pending before the Under Secretary under \u00a7 766.21 or \u00a7 766.22 of this part, the parties may submit a settlement proposal to the Under Secretary for approval and signature. If the Under Secretary approves the proposal, he/she will issue an appropriate order. If the Under Secretary does not approve the proposal, the case will proceed to final decision in accordance with \u00a7 766.21 or \u00a7 766.22 of this part, as appropriate.",
            "(c) Any order disposing of a case by settlement may suspend the administrative sanction imposed, in whole or in part, on such terms of probation or other conditions as the signing official may specify. Any such suspension may be modified or revoked by the signing official, in accordance with the procedures set forth in \u00a7 766.17(c) of this part.",
            "(d) Any respondent who agrees to an order imposing any administrative sanction does so solely for the purpose of resolving the claims in the administrative enforcement proceeding brought under this part. This reflects the fact that BIS has neither the authority nor the responsibility for instituting, conducting, settling, or otherwise disposing of criminal proceedings. That authority and responsibility are vested in the Attorney General and the Department of Justice.",

            "(f) Supplements nos. 1 and 2 to this part describe how BIS typically exercises its discretion regarding the terms under which it is willing to settle particular cases."

In order to prevent evasion, certain types of orders under this part may be made applicable not only to the respondent, but also to other persons then or thereafter related to the respondent by ownership, control, position of responsibility, affiliation, or other connection in the conduct of trade or business. Orders that may be made applicable to related persons include those that deny or affect export privileges, including temporary denial orders, and those that exclude a respondent from practice before BIS.",

If BIS has reason to believe that a person is related to the respondent and that an order that is being sought or that has been issued should be made applicable to that person in order to prevent evasion of the order, BIS shall, except in an ex parte proceeding under \u00a7 766.24(a) of this part, give that person notice in accordance with \u00a7 766.5(b) of this part and an opportunity to oppose such action.

For temporary denial orders issued on or before July 11, 1985, the proceedings will be governed by the applicable regulations in effect at the time the temporary denial orders were issued. Without limiting any other action BIS may take under the EAR with respect to any application, order, license or authorization issued under ECRA, BIS may ask the Assistant Secretary to issue a temporary denial order on an ex parte basis to prevent an imminent violation, as defined in this section, of the ECRA, the EAR, or any order, license or authorization issued thereunder. The temporary denial order will deny export privileges to any person named in the order as provided for in \u00a7 764.3(a)(2) of the EAR.",
            "(b) Issuance. (1) The Assistant Secretary may issue an order temporarily denying to a person any or all of the export privileges described in part 764 of the EAR upon a showing by BIS that the order is necessary in the public interest to prevent an imminent violation of ECRA, the EAR, or any order, license or authorization issued thereunder.",
            "(2) The temporary denial order shall define the imminent violation and state why it was issued without a hearing. Because all denial orders are public, the description of the imminent violation and the reasons for proceeding on an ex parte basis set forth therein shall be stated in a manner that is consistent with national security, foreign policy, business confidentiality, and investigative concerns.",
            "(3) A violation may be \u201cimminent\u201d either in time or in degree of likelihood. To establish grounds for the temporary denial order, BIS may show either that a violation is about to occur, or that the general circumstances of the matter under investigation or case under criminal or administrative charges demonstrate a likelihood of future violations. To indicate the likelihood of future violations, BIS may show that the violation under investigation or charges is significant, deliberate, covert and/or likely to occur again, rather than technical or negligent, and that it is appropriate to give notice to companies in the United States and abroad to cease dealing with the person in U.S.-origin items in order to reduce the likelihood that a person under investigation or charges continues to export or acquire abroad such items, risking subsequent disposition contrary to export control requirements. Lack of information establishing the precise time a violation may occur does not preclude a finding that a violation is imminent, so long as there is sufficient reason to believe the likelihood of a violation.",

            "(d) Renewal. (1) If, no later than 20 days before the expiration date of a temporary denial order, BIS believes that renewal of the denial order is necessary in the public interest to prevent an imminent violation, BIS may file a written request setting forth the basis for its belief, including any additional or changed circumstances, asking that the Assistant Secretary renew the temporary denial order, with modifications, if any are appropriate, for an additional period not exceeding 180 days. In cases demonstrating a pattern of repeated, ongoing and/or continuous apparent violations, BIS may request the renewal of a temporary denial order for an additional period not exceeding one year. BIS's request shall be delivered to the respondent, or any agent designated for this purpose, in accordance with \u00a7 766.5(b) of this part unless exceptional circumstances exist, which will constitute notice of the renewal application.",
            "(2) Non-resident respondents. To facilitate timely notice of renewal requests, a respondent not a resident of the United States may designate a local agent for this purpose and provide written notification of such designation to BIS in the manner set forth in \u00a7 766.5(b) of this part.",
            "(3) Hearing. (i) A respondent may oppose renewal of a temporary denial order by filing with the Assistant Secretary a written submission, supported by appropriate evidence, to be received not later than seven days before the expiration date of such order. For good cause shown, the Assistant Secretary may consider submissions received not later than five days before the expiration date. The Assistant Secretary ordinarily will not allow discovery; however, for good cause shown in respondent's submission, he/she may allow the parties to take limited discovery, consisting of a request for production of documents. If requested by the respondent in the written submission, the Assistant Secretary shall hold a hearing on the renewal application. The hearing shall be on the record and ordinarily will consist only of oral argument. The only issue to be considered on BIS's request for renewal is whether the temporary denial order should be continued to prevent an imminent violation as defined herein.",
            "(ii) Any person designated as a related person may not oppose the issuance or renewal of the temporary denial order, but may file an appeal in accordance with \u00a7 766.23(c) of this part.",
            "(iii) If no written opposition to BIS's renewal request is received within the specified time, the Assistant Secretary may issue the order renewing the temporary denial order without a hearing.",
            "(4) A temporary denial order may be renewed more than once.",
            "(e) Appeals\u2014(1) Filing. (i) A respondent may, at any time, file an appeal of the initial or renewed temporary denial order with the administrative law judge.",
            "(ii) The filing of an appeal shall stay neither the effectiveness of the temporary denial order nor any application for renewal, nor will it operate to bar the Assistant Secretary's consideration of any renewal application.",
            "(2) Grounds. A respondent may appeal on the grounds that the finding that the order is necessary in the public interest to prevent an imminent violation is unsupported.",
            "(3) Appeal procedure. A full written statement in support of the appeal must be filed with the appeal together with appropriate evidence, and be simultaneously served on BIS, which shall have seven days from receipt to file a reply. Service on the administrative law judge shall be addressed to U.S. Coast Guard, ALJ Docketing Center, 40 S. Gay Street, Baltimore, Maryland, 21202-4022. Service on BIS shall be as set forth in \u00a7 766.5(b) of this part. The administrative law judge normally will not hold hearings or entertain oral argument on appeals.",
            "(4) Recommended decision. Within 10 working days after an appeal is filed, the administrative law judge shall submit a recommended decision to the Under Secretary, and serve copies on the parties, recommending whether the issuance or the renewal of the temporary denial order should be affirmed, modified or vacated.",
            "(5) Final decision. Within five working days after receipt of the recommended decision, the Under Secretary shall issue a written order accepting, rejecting or modifying the recommended decision. Because of the time constraints, the Under Secretary's review will ordinarily be limited to the written record for decision, including the transcript of any hearing. The issuance or renewal of the temporary denial order shall be affirmed only if there is reason to believe that the temporary denial order is required in the public interest to prevent an imminent violation of ECRA, the EAR, or any order, license or other authorization issued under ECRA.",
            "(f) Delivery. A copy of any temporary denial order issued or renewed and any final decision on appeal shall be published in the Federal Register and shall be delivered to BIS and to the respondent, or any agent designated for this purpose, and to any related person in the same manner as provided in \u00a7 766.5 of this part for filing for papers other than a charging letter."

As part of its submission, the claimant must request that the specified license application be approved on the grounds of foreign availability. The evidence must relate to the particular export as described on the license application and to the alleged comparable item. If foreign availability is found, the Secretary will approve the license for the specific items, countries, and quantities listed on the application. The denied license assessment procedure, however, is not intended to result in the removal of the U.S. export control on an item by incrementally providing a country with amounts that, taken together, would constitute a sufficient quantity of an item. The Secretary will not approve on foreign availability grounds a denied license if the approval of such license would itself render the U.S. export control ineffective in achieving its purpose.

BIS will seek and consider all available information that bears upon the presence or absence of foreign availability, including but not limited to that evidence described in \u00a7 768.5 (b) and (c) of this part. As soon as BIS initiates the assessment, it will seek evidence relevant to the assessment, including an analysis of the military needs of a selected country or countries, technical analysis, and intelligence information from the Departments of Defense and State, and other U.S. agencies. Evidence is particularly sought from: industry sources worldwide; other U.S. organizations; foreign governments; commercial, academic and classified data bases; scientific and engineering research and development organizations; and international trade fairs.",

            "(d) Recommendation and determination. (1) Upon completion of each assessment, BIS, on the basis of its analysis, will recommend that the Secretary make a determination either that there is or that there is not foreign availability, whichever the evidence supports. The assessment upon which BIS bases its recommendation will accompany the recommendation to the Secretary.",
            "(2) BIS will recommend on the basis of its analysis that the Secretary determine that foreign availability exists to a country when the available evidence demonstrates that an item of comparable quality is available-in-fact to the country, from non-U.S. sources, in sufficient quantity so that continuation of the existing national security export control, or denial of the license application in question on national security grounds, would be ineffective in achieving its purpose. For a controlled country, such control or denial is \u201cineffective\u201d when comparable items are available-in-fact from foreign sources in sufficient quantities so that maintaining such control or denying a license would not be effective in restricting the availability of items that would make a significant contribution to the military potential of any country or combination of countries detrimental to the national security of the United States.",

BIS will provide all interested agencies and departments an opportunity to review source material, draft analyses and draft assessments immediately upon their receipt or production. For claimant-initiated assessments, BIS will provide a copy of all positive recommendations and assessments to interested agencies and departments for their review following the Secretary's determination of foreign availability. For self-initiated and TAC-initiated assessments, BIS will provide all interested agencies an opportunity to review and comment on the assessment.",

            "(ii) An NSO of a determination of foreign availability resulting from an assessment initiated pursuant to section 5(h) of the EAA (TAC-certification assessments).",
            "(3) For an NSO resulting from an assessment initiated under section 5(f) of the EAA, the Secretary of any agency may recommend that the President exercise the authority under the EAA to retain the controls or deny the license notwithstanding the finding of foreign availability.",
            "(4) For an NSO resulting from an assessment initiated under section 5(h) of the EAA, the Secretary of Commerce may recommend that the President exercise the authority under the EAA to retain the controls notwithstanding the finding of foreign availability.",
            "(5) Under an NSO resulting from an assessment initiated under section 5(f) of the EAA, the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on International Relations of the House of Representatives will be notified of the initiation of the required negotiations. The notice will include an explanation of the national security interest that necessitates the retention of controls.",
            "(6) Under an NSO resulting from an assessment initiated under section 5(f) of the EAA, BIS will publish notices in the Federal Register consisting of:",
            "(i) The Secretary's determination of foreign availability;",
            "(ii) The President's decision to exercise the NSO;",
            "(iii) A concise statement of the basis for the President's decision; and",
            "(iv) An estimate of the economic impact of the decision.",
            "(7) The 6 month effective period for an NSO may be extended up to an additional 12 months if, prior to the end of the 6 months, the President certifies to Congress that the negotiations are progressing, and determines that the absence of the controls would continue to be detrimental to the United States national security.",
            "(8) After the conclusion of negotiations, BIS will retain the control only to the extent that foreign availability is eliminated. If foreign availability is not eliminated, BIS will decontrol the item by removing the requirement for a license for the export of the item to the destinations covered by the assessment. To the extent that the negotiations are successful and the foreign availability is eliminated, BIS will remove the license requirement for the export of the item to any country that has agreed to eliminate foreign availability.",
            "(j) Changes in foreign availability. If BIS becomes aware of conditions, including new evidence, that affect a previous determination that foreign availability exists or does not exist, BIS may review the conditions. If BIS finds that the foreign availability previously determined no longer exists, or that foreign availability not earlier found now does exist, BIS will make a recommendation to the Secretary of Commerce for the appropriate changes in the control. The Secretary of Commerce will make a determination, and BIS will publish a Federal Register notice of the determination."

Moreover, the use of these standard commercial processes does not presumptively result in the control of the resulting U.S. Government ICs under ECCN paragraphs 3A001.a.1 or 9A515.d or .e; instead, the ECCNs of the U.S. Government ICs subject to the EAR would be determined according to paragraph (o)(1) of this section.",
            "(iii) If a standard commercial IC fabrication process at a particular foundry is comprised of tools specified under ECCNs 3B001 or 3B991 or as EAR99, and where the \u201ctechnology\u201d is limited to \u201ctechnology\u201d specified under ECCN 3E991 or as EAR99, and that foundry (which typically produces ICs specified under ECCN 3A991 or as EAR99) were to deviate from its standard fabrication process (e.g., by adding special process steps or design features) to produce a family of ICs designed to meet or exceed the radiation hardened parameters in ECCN paragraphs 3A001.a.1 or 9A515.d. or .e and intended for sale to U.S. and non-U.S. commercial and government customers, then the ECCN of the additional process \u201ctechnology\u201d that is \u201crequired\u201d for producing those specific radiation hardened ICs would need to be separately evaluated and determined (e.g., under ECCNs 3E001 and 9E515, as applicable)."

            "(ii) Answer 1. Export of technology includes release of U.S.-origin data in a foreign country as defined in \u00a7 734.15 of the EAR. So long as the circumstances described here would not exceed that permitted under the License Exception TSU for operation technology and software, as described in \u00a7 740.13(a) of the EAR, this is not a \u201crelease\u201d of technology and a license would not be required.",

We plan, according to our normal business practices, to train customer engineers to maintain equipment that we have exported under a license, License Exception, or NLR. The training is contractual in nature, provided for a fee, and is scheduled to take place in part in the customer's facility and in part in the U.S. Can we now proceed with this training at both locations under a License Exception?",
            "(ii) Answer 2. (A) Provided that this is your normal training, and involves technology contained in your manuals and standard instructions for the exported equipment, and meets the other requirements of License Exception TSU for operation technology and software described in \u00a7 740.13(a), the training may be provided within the limits of those provisions of License Exception TSU. The location of the training is not significant, as the export occurs at the time and place of the actual transfer or imparting of the technology to the customer's engineers.",

            "(a) Scope of the control list. In this part, references to the EAR are references to 15 CFR chapter VII, subchapter C. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) maintains the Commerce Control List (CCL) that includes \u201citems\u201d\u2014i.e., \u201ccommodities,\u201d \u201csoftware,\u201d and \u201ctechnology\u201d\u2014subject to the authority of BIS. The CCL does not include items exclusively controlled for export by another department or agency of the U.S. Government, though in instances where other agencies administer controls over related items, entries in the CCL may contain a reference to such controls. In addition, those items \u201csubject to the EAR\u201d but not identified on the CCL are identified by the designator \u201cEAR99.\u201d See \u00a7 734.2(a) of the EAR for items that are \u201csubject to the EAR.\u201d EAR Part 738 contains an explanation of the organization of the CCL and its relationship to the Country Chart.",
            "(b) ECCN cross-references for items subject to exclusive jurisdiction of another agency. (1) Prior to October 15, 2013, the CCL contained certain ECCNs that were only included as cross references to items subject to the export control regulations administered by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.",
            "(2) ECCNs formerly listed on the CCL that, as of October 15, 2013 were subject to the export licensing authority of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission at 10 CFR part 110 are: 0A001, 0B001, 0B002, 0B003, 0B004, 0B005, 0B006, 0C001, 0C002, 0C004, 0C005, 0C006, 0C201 and 1C012.",
            "(3) The following multilateral export control regime reference is provided, as an additional point of historical reference: 0C201\u2014INFCIRC 254 Part 1, 5.3.1(b).",
            "(c) Where to find the CCL? The CCL is contained in supplement no. 1 to this part, and supplement no. 2 to this part contains the General Technology and Software Notes relevant to entries contained in the CCL.",
            "(d) Conventions related to the use of quotation marks on the CCL. The use of double quotation marks on the CCL is intended to be an aid to alert you to terms used on the CCL that are defined in part 772 (Definitions of Terms), or for purposes of ECCNs, where a definition is provided in the \u201crelated definitions\u201d paragraph in the License Requirements section of ECCNs or sometimes in Notes and Technical Notes for particular ECCNs and that definition is specific to that particular ECCN. In this sense the quotes are helpful both in the use of single and double quotes, but a good compliance practice is to familiarize yourself with the defined terms in part 772, and when reviewing a control parameter on the CCL that uses a term that is not in quotes to be aware it may be defined in part 772. It is also a useful compliance practice to review the \u201cRelated Definitions\u201d paragraph and Notes and Technical Notes to determine if the term is defined for purposes of a particular ECCN.",
            "(1) Use of double quotes. If a term on the CCL uses double quotes it means there is a defined term in part 772. However, the absence of double quotes does not mean that a term used on the CCL is not defined in part 772. Because the CCL includes many terms that are defined in part 772, BIS's practice is to use double quotes for certain key terms and to use double quotes when needed for consistency with multilateral export control regime based entries, such as many derived from control lists, in particular for the Wassenaar Arrangement that also uses the double quotes convention. However, because of the large number of defined terms used on the CCL and a desire to avoid hindering readability by placing quotes around too many words used in particular ECCNs, BIS's practice is to not add double quotes around certain terms, such as items and commodities. This convention also applies to the use of double quotes within the Definition of Terms section under part 772.",
            "(2) Use of single quotes. The CCL also includes a convention regarding the use of single quotes. Single quotes on the CCL identify a term as a defined term in the context of a particular ECCN. This convention also applies to the use of single quotes within the Definition of Terms section under part 772.",
            "(e) Chemicals identified by Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) number. In some instances chemicals are listed by name and CAS number. The list applies to chemicals of the same structural formula (including hydrates) regardless of name or CAS number. CAS numbers are shown to assist in identifying a particular chemical or mixture, irrespective of nomenclature. CAS numbers cannot be used as unique identifiers because some forms of the listed chemical have different CAS numbers, and mixtures containing a listed chemical may also have different CAS numbers."

            "(a) General. The Additional Protocol is a supplement to the existing U.S.-IAEA Safeguards Agreement, which entered into force in 1980. It provides the IAEA with access to additional information about civil nuclear and nuclear-related items, materials, and activities and with physical access to reportable locations where nuclear facilities, materials, or ores are located (to ensure the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities) and to other reportable locations and locations specified by the IAEA (to resolve questions or inconsistencies related to the U.S. Declaration). The Additional Protocol is based upon and is virtually identical to the IAEA Model Additional Protocol (see IAEA Information Circular, INFCIRC/540, at http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Documents/Infcircs/index.html), except that it excludes IAEA access to activities with direct national security significance to the United States, or to locations or information associated with such activities, and provides for managed access in connection with those same activities and to locations or information associated with those activities.",
            "(b) Purposes of the Additional Protocol. The Additional Protocol is designed to enhance the effectiveness of the U.S.-IAEA Safeguards Agreement by providing the IAEA with information about aspects of the U.S. civil nuclear fuel cycle, including: Mining and concentration of nuclear ores; nuclear-related equipment manufacturing, assembly, or construction; imports, exports, and other activities involving certain source material (i.e., source material that has not reached the composition and purity suitable for fuel fabrication or for being isotopically enriched); imports and exports of specified nuclear equipment and non-nuclear material; nuclear fuel cycle-related research and development activities not involving nuclear material; and other activities involving nuclear material not currently subject to the U.S.-IAEA Safeguards Agreement (e.g., nuclear material that has been exempted from safeguards pursuant to paragraph 37 of INFCIRC/153 (Corrected) June 1972).",
            "(c) Purposes of the Additional Protocol Regulations. To fulfill certain obligations of the United States under the Additional Protocol, BIS has established the APR, which require the reporting of information to BIS (as described in parts 783 and 784 of the APR) from all persons and locations in the United States (as described in \u00a7 781.3(a) of the APR) with reportable activities. This information, together with information reported to other U.S. Government agencies and less any information to which the U.S. Government applies the national security exclusion, is aggregated into a U.S. declaration, which is submitted annually to the IAEA.

The NOVA shall constitute a formal complaint and will set forth the alleged violation(s) and the essential facts with respect to the alleged violation(s), reference the relevant statutory, regulatory or other provisions, and state the maximum amount of the civil penalty that could be assessed. The NOVA also will inform the respondent of the requirement to request a hearing pursuant to \u00a7 785.4 of the APR.",

For example, companies and/or subsidiaries and other separable parts of companies in the following industries are defined as financial services providers: Depository credit intermediation and related activities (including commercial banking, savings institutions, credit unions, and other depository credit intermediation); non-depository credit intermediation (including credit card issuing, sales financing, and other non-depository credit intermediation); activities related to credit intermediation (including mortgage and nonmortgage loan brokers, financial transactions processing, reserve, and clearinghouse activities, and other activities related to credit intermediation); securities and commodity contracts intermediation and brokerage (including investment banking and securities dealing, securities brokerage, commodity contracts and dealing, and commodity contracts brokerage); securities and commodity exchanges; other financial investment activities (including miscellaneous intermediation, portfolio management, investment advice, and all other financial investment activities); insurance carriers; insurance agencies, brokerages, and other insurance related activities; insurance and employee benefit funds (including pension funds, health and welfare funds, and other insurance funds); other investment pools and funds (including open-end investment funds, trusts, estates, and agency accounts, real estate investment trusts, and other financial vehicles); and holding companies that own, or influence the management decisions of, firms principally engaged in the aforementioned activities.",

The $3 million threshold for sales and purchases should be applied to financial services transactions with foreign persons by all parts of the consolidated domestic U.S. Reporter.
