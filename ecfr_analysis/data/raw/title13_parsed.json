However, each agreement must indicate that both parties agree not to engage in any sharing of secondary market premiums, that the services to be provided are accurately described, and that the agreement is otherwise consistent with SBA requirements. Subject to the prohibition on splitting premiums, lenders have reasonable discretion in setting compensation for Lender Service Providers. However, such compensation may not be directly charged to an Applicant or Borrower."

            "(a)(1) General. The objective of the SBA's contracting programs is to assist small business concerns, including 8(a) BD Participants, HUBZone small business concerns, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Concerns, Women-Owned Small Businesses and Economically Disadvantaged Women-Owned Small Businesses, in obtaining a fair share of Federal Government prime contracts, subcontracts, orders, and property sales. Therefore, these regulations apply to all types of Federal Government contracts, including Multiple Award Contracts, and contracts for architectural and engineering services, research, development, test and evaluation. Small business concerns must receive any award (including orders, and orders placed against Multiple Award Contracts) or contract, part of any such award or contract, any contract for the sale of Government property, or any contract resulting from a reverse auction, regardless of the place of performance, which SBA and the procuring or disposal agency determine to be in the interest of:",

            "(2) One acceptable offer. If the contracting officer receives only one acceptable offer from a responsible small business concern in response to any small or socioeconomic set-aside, the contracting officer should make an award to that firm.",
            "(b) SBA's responsibilities in the acquisition planning process\u2014(1) SBA Procurement Center Representative (PCR) Responsibilities\u2014",
            "(i) PCR Review\u2014(A) SBA has PCRs who are generally located at Federal agencies and buying activities which have major contracting programs. \n\nAt the SBA's discretion, PCRs may review any acquisition to determine whether a set-aside or sole-source award to a small business under one of SBA's programs is appropriate and to identify alternative strategies to maximize the participation of small businesses in the procurement. PCRs also advocate for the maximum practicable utilization of small business concerns in Federal contracting, including by advocating against the consolidation or bundling of contract requirements, as defined in \u00a7 125.1, and reviewing any justification provided by the agency for consolidation or bundling. This review includes acquisitions that are Multiple Award Contracts where the agency has not set-aside all or part of the acquisition or reserved the acquisition for small businesses. It also includes acquisitions where the agency has not set-aside orders placed against Multiple Award Contracts for small business concerns. Unless the contracting agency requests a review, PCRs will not review an acquisition by or on behalf of the Department of Defense if the acquisition is conducted for a foreign government pursuant to section 22 of the Arms Control Export Act (22 U.S.C. 2762), is humanitarian or civic assistance provided in conjunction with military operations as defined in 10 U.S.C. 401(e), is for a contingency operation as defined in 10 U.S.C. 101(a)(13), is to be awarded pursuant to an agreement with the government of a foreign country in which Armed Forces of the United States are deployed, or where both the place of award and place of performance are entirely outside of the United States and its territories.",
            "(B) PCRs will work with the cognizant Small Business Specialist (SBS) and agency OSDBU or OSBP as early in the acquisition process as practicable to identify proposed solicitations that involve bundling, and with the agency acquisition officials to revise the acquisition strategies for such proposed solicitations, where appropriate, to increase the probability of participation by small businesses, including small business contract teams and Small Business Teaming Arrangements, as prime contractors.",
            "(C) In conjunction with their duties to promote the set-aside of procurements for small business, PCRs may identify small businesses that are capable of performing particular requirements.",
            "(D) PCRs will also ensure that any Federal agency decision made concerning the consolidation of contract requirements considers the use of small businesses and ways to provide small businesses with maximum opportunities to participate as prime contractors and subcontractors in the acquisition or sale of real property.",
            "(E) PCRs will review whether, for bundled and consolidated contracts that are recompeted, the amount of savings and benefits was achieved under the prior bundling or consolidation of contract requirements, that such savings and benefits will continue to be realized if the contract remains bundled or consolidated, or such savings and benefits would be greater if the procurement requirements were divided into separate solicitations suitable for award to small business concerns.",
            "(F) PCRs also advocate competitive procedures and recommend the breakout for competition of items and requirements which previously have not been competed when appropriate. They may appeal the failure by the buying activity to act favorably on a recommendation in accord with the appeal procedures in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. PCRs also review restrictions and obstacles to competition and make recommendations for improvement.",
            "(ii) PCR recommendations. The PCR must recommend to the procuring activity alternative procurement methods that would increase small business prime contract participation if a PCR believes that a proposed procurement includes in its statement of work goods or services currently being performed by a small business and is in a quantity or estimated dollar value the magnitude of which renders small business prime contract participation unlikely; will render small business prime contract participation unlikely (e.g., ensure geographical preferences are justified); or is for construction and seeks to package or consolidate discrete construction projects. If a PCR does not believe a bundled or consolidated requirement is necessary or justified the PCR shall advocate against the consolidation or bundling of such requirement and recommend to the procuring activity alternative procurement methods which would increase small business prime contract participation. Such alternatives may include:",
            "(A) Breaking up the procurement into smaller discrete procurements, especially construction acquisitions that can be procured as separate projects;",
            "(B) Breaking out one or more discrete components, for which a small business set-aside may be appropriate;",

            "(D) Using a partial set-aside;",
            "(E) Stating in the solicitation for a Multiple Award Contract that the orders will be set-aside for small businesses; and",

            "(iii) PCR Recommendations for Small Business Teaming Arrangements and Subcontracting. The PCR will work to ensure that small business participation is maximized both at the prime contract level such as through Small Business Teaming Arrangements and through subcontracting opportunities. This may include the subcontracting considerations in source selections set forth in \u00a7 125.3(g), as well as the following:",
            "(A) Reviewing an agency's oversight of its subcontracting program, including its overall and individual assessment of a contractor's compliance with its small business subcontracting plans. The PCR will furnish a copy of the information to the SBA Commercial Market Representative (CMR) servicing the contractor;",

            "(C) Recommending that the small business subcontracting goals be based on total contract dollars in addition to goals based on a percentage of total subcontracted dollars;",
            "(D) Recommending that separate evaluation factors be established for evaluating the offerors' proposed approach to small business subcontracting participation in the subject procurement, the extent to which the offeror has met its small business subcontracting goals on previous contracts; and/or the extent to which the offeror actually paid small business subcontractors within the specified number of days;",
            "(E) Recommending that a contracting officer include an evaluation factor in a solicitation which evaluates an offeror's commitment to pay small business subcontractors within a specified number of days after receipt of payment from the Government for goods and services previously rendered by the small business subcontractor. The contracting officer will comparatively evaluate the proposed timelines. Such a commitment shall become a material part of the contract. The contracting officer must consider the contractor's compliance with the commitment in evaluating performance, including for purposes of contract continuation (such as exercising options);",
            "(F) For bundled and consolidated requirements, recommending that a separate evaluation factor with significant weight be established for evaluating the offeror's proposed approach to small business utilization, the extent to which the offeror has met its small business subcontracting goals on previous contracts; and the extent to which the other than small business offeror actually paid small business subcontractors within the specified number of days;",
            "(G) For bundled or consolidated requirements, recommending the solicitation state that the agency must evaluate offers from teams of small businesses the same as other offers, with due consideration to the capabilities and past performance of all proposed subcontractors. It may also include recommending that the agency reserve at least one award to a small business prime contractor with a Small Business Teaming Arrangement;",
            "(H) For Multiple Award Contracts and multiple award requirements above the substantial bundling threshold, recommending or requiring that the solicitation state that the agency will solicit offers from small business concerns and small business concerns with Small Business Teaming Arrangements;",
            "(I) For consolidated contracts, ensuring that agencies have provided small business concerns with appropriate opportunities to participate as prime contractors and subcontractors and making recommendations on such opportunities as appropriate; and",
            "(J) Recommending paragraphs (B) through (I) above apply to an ordering agency placing an order against a Multiple Award Contract or Agreement.",
            "(iv) PCRs will consult with the agency OSDBU regarding agency decisions to convert an activity performed by a small business concern to an activity performed by a Federal employee.",
            "(v) PCRs may receive unsolicited proposals from small business concerns and will transmit those proposals to the agency personnel responsible for reviewing such proposals. The agency personnel shall provide the PCR with information regarding the disposition of such proposal.",
            "(2) Appeals of PCR recommendations. In cases where there is disagreement between a PCR and the contracting officer over the suitability of a particular acquisition for a small business set-aside, partial set-aside or reserve, whether or not the acquisition is a bundled, substantially bundled or consolidated requirement, the PCR may initiate an appeal to the head of the contracting activity. If the head of the contracting activity agrees with the contracting officer, SBA may appeal the matter to the Secretary of the Department or head of the agency. The time limits for such appeals are set forth in FAR subpart 19.5 (48 CFR 19.5).",
            "(c) Procuring Agency Responsibilities\u2014(1) Requirement to Foster Small Business Participation. The Small Business Act requires each Federal agency to foster the participation of small business concerns as prime contractors and subcontractors in the contracting opportunities of the Government regardless of the place of performance of the contract. In addition, Federal agencies must ensure that all bundled and consolidated contracts contain the required analysis and justification and provide small business concerns with appropriate opportunities to participate as prime contractors and subcontractors. Agency acquisition planners must:",
            "(i) Structure procurement requirements to facilitate competition by and among small business concerns, including small business concerns owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans, certified HUBZone small business concerns , 8(a) BD small business concerns (including those owned by ANCs, Indian Tribes and NHOs), and small business concerns owned and controlled by women;",
            "(ii) Avoid unnecessary and unjustified bundling of contracts or consolidation of contract requirements that inhibits or precludes small business participation in procurements as prime contractors;",
            "(iii) Follow the limitations on use of consolidated contracts;",
            "(iv) With respect to any work to be performed the amount of which would exceed the maximum amount of any contract for which a surety may be guaranteed against loss under 15 U.S.C. 694b, to the extent practicable, place contracts so as to allow more than one small business concern to perform such work;",
            "(v) Provide SBA the necessary information relating to the acquisition under review at least 30 days prior to issuance of a solicitation. This includes providing PCRs (to the extent allowable pursuant to their security clearance) copies of all documents relating to the acquisition under review, including, but not limited to, the performance of work statement/statement of work, technical data, market research, hard copies or their electronic equivalents of Department of Defense (DoD) Form 2579 or equivalent, and other relevant information. The DoD Form 2579 or equivalent must be sent electronically to the PCR (or if a PCR is not assigned to the procuring activity, to the SBA Office of Government Contracting Area Office serving the area in which the buying activity is located);",
            "(vi) Provide opportunities for the participation of small business concerns during acquisition planning processes and in acquisition plans; and",
            "(vii) Invite the participation of the appropriate Director of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization in acquisition planning processes and provide that Director with access to acquisition plans.",
            "(2) Requirement for market research. Each agency, as part of its acquisition planning, must conduct market research to determine the type and extent of foreseeable small business participation in the acquisition. In addition, each agency must conduct market research and any required analysis and justifications before proceeding with an acquisition strategy that could lead to a bundled, substantially bundled, or consolidated contract. The purpose of the market research and analysis is to determine whether the bundling or consolidation of the requirements is necessary and justified and all statutory requirements for such a strategy have been met. Agencies should be as broad as possible in their search for qualified small businesses, using key words as well as NAICS codes in their examination of the System for Award Management (SAM) and the Dynamic Small Business Search (DSBS), and must not place unnecessary and unjustified restrictions when conducting market research (e.g., requiring that small businesses prove they can provide the best scientific and technological sources) when determining whether to set-aside, partially set-aside, reserve or sole source a requirement to small businesses. During the market research phase, the acquisition team must consult with the applicable PCR (or if a PCR is not assigned to the procuring activity, the SBA Office of Government Contracting Area Office serving the area in which the buying activity is located) and the activity's Small Business Specialist.",
            "(3) Proposed Acquisition Strategy. A procuring activity must provide to the applicable PCR (or to the SBA Office of Government Contracting Area Office serving the area in which the buying activity is located if a PCR is not assigned to the procuring activity) at least 30 days prior to a solicitation's issuance:",

            "(ii) A written statement explaining why, if the proposed acquisition strategy involves a bundled or consolidated requirement, the procuring activity believes that the bundled or consolidated requirement is necessary and justified; the analysis required by paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section; the acquisition plan; any bundling information required under paragraph (d)(3) of this section; and any other relevant information. The PCR and agency OSDBU or OSBP, as applicable, must then work together to develop alternative acquisition strategies identified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section to enhance small business participation;",
            "(iii) All required clearances for the bundled, substantially bundled, or consolidated requirement; and",
            "(iv) A written statement explaining why\u2014if the description of the requirement includes goods or services currently being performed by a small business and the magnitude of the quantity or estimated dollar value of the proposed procurement would render small business prime contract participation unlikely, or if a proposed procurement for construction seeks to package or consolidate discrete construction projects\u2014",
            "(A) The proposed acquisition cannot be divided into reasonably small lots to permit offers on quantities less than the total requirement;",

            "(i) As early in the acquisition planning process as practicable\u2014but no later than 30 days before the issuance of a solicitation, or prior to placing an order without a solicitation\u2014the procuring activity must coordinate with the procuring activity's SBS when the acquisition strategy contemplates an acquisition meeting the dollar amounts set forth for substantial bundling. If the acquisition strategy contemplates Multiple Award Contracts or orders under the GSA Multiple Award Schedule Program or a task or delivery order contract awarded by another agency, these thresholds apply to the cumulative estimated value of the Multiple Award Contracts or orders, including options. The procuring activity is not required to coordinate with its SBS if the contract or order is entirely set-aside for small business concerns, or small businesses under one of SBA's small business programs, as authorized under the Small Business Act.",
            "(ii) The SBS must notify the agency OSDBU or OSBP if the agency's acquisition strategy or plan includes bundled or consolidated requirements that the agency has not identified as bundled, or includes unnecessary or unjustified bundling of requirements. If the strategy involves substantial bundling, the SBS must assist in identifying alternative strategies that would reduce or minimize the scope of the bundling.",

            "(iv) Facilitate small business participation as subcontractors and suppliers, if a solicitation for a substantially bundled contract is to be issued;",
            "(v) Assist small business concerns to obtain payments, required late payment interest penalties, or information regarding payments due to such concerns from an executive agency or a contractor, in conformity with chapter 39 of Title 31 or any other protection for contractors or subcontractors (including suppliers) that is included in the FAR or any individual agency supplement to such Government-wide regulation;",
            "(vi) Cooperate, and consult on a regular basis with the SBA with respect to carrying out these functions and duties;",
            "(vii) Make recommendations to contracting officers as to whether a particular contract requirement should be awarded to any type of small business. The Contracting Officer must document any reason not to accept such recommendations and include the documentation in the appropriate contract file; and",

            "(6) Prohibition on competitions requiring or favoring additional socioeconomic certifications. A procuring activity cannot create a small business set-aside or reserve (for either a contract, order or agreement) that requires multiple socioeconomic certifications in addition to a size certification (e.g., a competition cannot be limited only to small business concerns that are also 8(a) and HUBZone certified) or give evaluation preferences to concerns having multiple socioeconomic certifications.",
            "(7) Communication on Achieving Goals. All Senior Procurement Executives, senior program managers, Directors of OSDBU or Directors of OSBP must communicate to their subordinates the importance of achieving small business goals and ensuring that a fair proportion of awards are made to small businesses.",
            "(d) Contract Consolidation and Bundling\u2014(1) Limitation on the Use of Consolidated Contracts. (i) An agency may not conduct an acquisition that is a consolidation of contract requirements unless the Senior Procurement Executive or Chief Acquisition Officer for the Federal agency, before carrying out the acquisition strategy:",
            "(A) Conducts adequate market research;",
            "(B) Identifies any alternative contracting approaches that would involve a lesser degree of consolidation of contract requirements;",
            "(C) Makes a written determination, which is coordinated with the agency's OSDBU/OSBP, that the consolidation of contract requirements is necessary and justified;",
            "(D) Identifies any negative impact by the acquisition strategy on contracting with small business concerns; and",
            "(E) Ensures that steps will be taken to include small business concerns in the acquisition strategy.",
            "(ii) A Senior Procurement Executive or Chief Acquisition Officer may determine that an acquisition strategy involving a consolidation of contract requirements is necessary and justified.",
            "(A) A consolidation of contract requirements may be necessary and justified if the benefits of the acquisition strategy substantially exceed the benefits of each of the possible alternative contracting approaches identified under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(B).",
            "(B) The benefits may include cost savings and/or price reduction, quality improvements that will save time or improve or enhance performance or efficiency, reduction in acquisition cycle times, better terms and conditions, and any other benefits that individually, in combination, or in the aggregate would lead to: benefits equivalent to 10 percent of the contract or order value (including options) where the contract or order value is $94 million or less; or benefits equivalent to 5 percent of the contract or order value (including options) or $9.4 million, whichever is greater, where the contract or order value exceeds $94 million.",
            "(C) Savings in administrative or personnel costs alone do not constitute a sufficient justification for a consolidation of contract requirements in a procurement unless the expected total amount of the cost savings, as determined by the Senior Procurement Executive or Chief Acquisition Officer, is expected to be substantial in relation to the total cost of the procurement. To be substantial, such administrative or personnel cost savings must be at least 10 percent of the contract value (including options).",
            "(iii) Each agency must ensure that any decision made concerning the consolidation of contract requirements considers the use of small businesses and ways to provide small businesses with opportunities to participate as prime contractors and subcontractors in the acquisition.",
            "(iv) If the consolidated requirement is also considered a bundled requirement, then the contracting officer must instead follow the provisions regarding bundling set forth in paragraphs (d)(2) through (7) of this section.",
            "(v) Not later than 7 days after making a determination that an acquisition strategy involving a consolidation of contract requirements is necessary and justified under subparagraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, the Senior Procurement Executive (SPE) or Chief Acquisition Officer (CAO), or designee, shall publish a notice on the Government Point of Entry (GPE) that such determination has been made. Any solicitation for a procurement related to the acquisition strategy shall not be issued earlier than 7 days after such notice is published. Along with the publication of the solicitation, the SPE or CAO (or designee) must publish in the GPE the justification for the determination, which shall include the information in paragraphs (d)(1)(i)(A) through (E) of this section.",
            "(2) Limitation on the Use of Contract Bundling.\n\n(i) When the procuring activity intends to proceed with an acquisition involving bundled or substantially bundled procurement requirements, it must document the acquisition strategy to include a determination that the bundling is necessary and justified, when compared to the benefits that could be derived from meeting the agency's requirements through separate smaller contracts.",
            "(ii) A bundled requirement is necessary and justified if, as compared to the benefits that the procuring activity would derive from contracting to meet those requirements if not bundled, it would derive measurably substantial benefits. The procuring activity must quantify the identified benefits and explain how their impact would be measurably substantial. This analysis must include quantification of the reduction or increase in price of the proposed bundled strategy as compared to the cumulative value of the separate contracts. The benefits may include cost savings and/or price reduction, quality improvements that will save time or improve or enhance performance or efficiency, reduction in acquisition cycle times, better terms and conditions, and any other benefits that individually, in combination, or in the aggregate would lead to:",
            "(A) Benefits equivalent to 10 percent of the contract or order value (including options), where the contract or order value is $94 million or less; or",

            "(iii) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, the Senior Procurement Executives or the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology (for other Defense Agencies) in the Department of Defense and the Deputy Secretary or equivalent in civilian agencies may, on a non-delegable basis, determine that a bundled requirement is necessary and justified when:",
            "(A) There are benefits that do not meet the thresholds set forth in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section but, in the aggregate, are critical to the agency's mission success; and",
            "(B) The procurement strategy provides for maximum practicable participation by small business.",
            "(iv) The reduction of administrative or personnel costs alone must not be a justification for bundling of contract requirements unless the administrative or personnel cost savings are expected to be substantial, in relation to the dollar value of the procurement to be bundled (including options). To be substantial, such administrative or personnel cost savings must be at least 10 percent of the contract value (including options).",
            "(v) In assessing whether cost savings and/or a price reduction would be achieved through bundling, the procuring activity and SBA must compare the price that has been charged by small businesses for the work that they have performed and, where available, the price that could have been or could be charged by small businesses for the work not previously performed by small business.",

            "(5) Notification to Current Small Business Contractors of Intent to Bundle. The procuring activity must notify each small business which is performing a contract that it intends to bundle that requirement with one or more other requirements at least 30 days prior to the issuance of the solicitation for the bundled or substantially bundled requirement. The procuring activity, at that time, should also provide to the small business the name, phone number and address of the applicable SBA PCR (or if a PCR is not assigned to the procuring activity, the SBA Office of Government Contracting Area Office serving the area in which the buying activity is located). This notification must be documented in the contract file.",
            "(6) Notification to Public of Rationale for Bundled Requirement. The head of a Federal agency must publish on the agency's Web site a list and rationale for any bundled requirement for which the agency solicited offers or issued an award. The notification must be made within 30 days of the agency's data certification regarding the validity and verification of data entered in that Federal Procurement Data Base to the Office of Federal Procurement Policy. However, to foster transparency in Federal procurement, the agency is encouraged to provide such notification before issuance of the solicitation.",
            "(7) Notification to public of rationale for substantial bundling. If the head of a contracting agency determines that an acquisition plan for a procurement involves a substantial bundling of contract requirements, the head of a contracting agency shall publish a notice on the GPE that such determination has been made not later than 7 days after making such determination. Any solicitation for a procurement related to the acquisition plan may not be published earlier than 7 days after such notice is published. Along with the publication of the solicitation, the head of a contracting agency shall publish in the GPE a justification for the determination, which shall include the following information:",

            "(i) The amount of savings and benefits achieved under the prior bundling or consolidation of contract requirements;",
            "(ii) Whether such savings and benefits will continue to be realized if the contract remains bundled or consolidated; and",
            "(iii) Whether such savings and benefits would be greater if the procurement requirements were divided into separate solicitations suitable for award to small business concerns.",
            "(e) Multiple Award Contract\u2014(1) General.(i) The contracting officer must set-aside a Multiple Award Contract if the requirements for a set-aside are met. This includes set-asides for small businesses, 8(a) Participants, HUBZone SBCs, SDVO SBCs, WOSBs or EDWOSBs.",
            "(ii) The contracting officer in his or her discretion may partially set-aside or reserve a Multiple Award Contract, or set aside, or preserve the right to set aside, orders against a Multiple Award Contract that was not itself set aside for small business. The ultimate decision of whether to use any of the above-mentioned tools in any given procurement action is a decision of the contracting agency.",

            "(ii) The contracting officer must assign a NAICS code to the solicitation for the Multiple Award Contract and each order pursuant to \u00a7 121.402(c) of this chapter. See \u00a7 121.404 for further determination on size status for the Multiple Award Contract and each order issued against that contract.",
            "(iii) When drafting the solicitation for the contract, agencies should consider an \u201con-ramp\u201d provision that permits the agency to refresh the awards by adding more small business contractors throughout the life of the contract. Agencies should also consider the need to \u201coff-ramp\u201d existing contractors that no longer qualify as small for the size standard corresponding to the NAICS code assigned to the contract (e.g., termination for convenience).",
            "(iv) A business must comply with the applicable limitations on subcontracting provisions (see \u00a7 125.6) and the nonmanufacturer rule (see \u00a7 121.406(b)), if applicable, during each performance period of the contract (e.g., the base term and each subsequent option period).

            "(3) Partial Set-asides of Multiple Award Contracts.\n\n(i) A contracting officer may partially set-aside a multiple award contract when: market research indicates that a total set-aside is not appropriate; the procurement can be broken up into smaller discrete portions or discrete categories such as by Contract Line Items, Special Item Numbers, Sectors or Functional Areas or other equivalent; and two or more small business concerns, 8(a) BD Participants, HUBZone SBCs, SDVO SBCs, WOSBs or EDWOSBs are expected to submit an offer on the set-aside part or parts of the requirement at a fair market price. A contracting officer has the discretion, but is not required, to set-aside the discrete portions or categories for different small businesses participating in SBA's small business programs (e.g., CLIN 0001, 8(a) set-aside; CLIN 0002, HUBZone set-aside; CLIN 0003, SDVO SBC set-aside; CLIN 0004, WOSB set-aside; CLIN 0005 EDWOSB set-aside; CLIN 0006, small business set-aside).

The business concern will not have to comply with the limitations on subcontracting (see \u00a7 125.6) and the nonmanufacturer rule for any order issued against the Multiple Award Contract if the order is competed and awarded under the portion of the contract that is not set-aside.",
            "(v) When drafting the solicitation for the contract, agencies should consider an \u201con ramp\u201d provision that permits the agency to refresh these awards by adding more small business contractors to that portion of the contract that was set-aside throughout the life of the contract. Agencies should also consider the need to \u201doff ramp\u201d existing contractors that no longer qualify as small for the size standard corresponding to the NAICS code assigned to the contract (e.g., termination for convenience).",
            "(vi) The small business must submit one offer that addresses each part of the solicitation for which it wants to compete. A small business (or 8(a) Participant, HUBZone SBC, SDVO SBC or ED/WOSB) is not required to submit an offer on the part of the solicitation that is not set-aside. However, a small business may choose to submit an offer on the part or parts of the solicitation that have been set-aside and/or on the parts that have not been set-aside.",
            "(vii) A small business must comply with the applicable limitations on subcontracting provisions (see \u00a7 125.6) and the nonmanufacturer rule (see \u00a7 121.406(b)), if applicable, during each performance period of the contract (e.g., during the base term and then during option period thereafter).

However, a business need not comply with the limitations on subcontracting provisions (see \u00a7 125.6) and the nonmanufacturer rule for any order issued against the Multiple Award Contract if the order is competed amongst small and other-than-small business concerns.",
            "(5) Reserve of Multiple Award Contracts that are Bundled.",
            "(i) If the contracting officer decides to reserve a multiple award contract established through full and open competition that is a bundled contract, the contracting officer must assign a NAICS code to the solicitation for the Multiple Award Contract and each order issued against the Multiple Award Contract pursuant to \u00a7 121.402(c) of this chapter.

            "(i) Notwithstanding the fair opportunity requirements set forth in 10 U.S.C. 2304c and 41 U.S.C. 4106(c), a contracting officer may set aside orders for small businesses, eligible 8(a) Participants, certified HUBZone small business concerns, SDVO small business concerns, WOSBs, and EDWOSBs against full and open Multiple Award Contracts. In addition, a contracting officer may set aside orders for eligible 8(a) Participants, certified HUBZone small business concerns, SDVO small business concerns, WOSBs, and EDWOSBs against total small business set-aside Multiple Award Contracts, partial small business set-aside Multiple Award Contracts, and small business reserves of Multiple Award Contracts awarded in full and open competition. Although a contracting officer can set aside orders issued under a small business set-aside Multiple Award Contract or reserve to any subcategory of small businesses, contracting officers are encouraged to review the award dollars under the Multiple Award Contract and aim to make available for award at least 50% of the award dollars under the Multiple Award Contract to all contract holders of the underlying small business set-aside Multiple Award Contract or reserve. However, a contracting officer may not further set aside orders for specific types of small business concerns against Multiple Award Contracts that are set-aside or reserved for eligible 8(a) Participants, certified HUBZone small business concerns, SDVO small business concerns, WOSBs, and EDWOSBs (e.g., a contracting officer cannot set-aside an order for 8(a) Participants that are also certified HUBZone small business concerns against an 8(a) Multiple Award Contract).",
            "(ii) The contracting officer may state in the solicitation and resulting contract for the Multiple Award Contract that:",
            "(A) Based on the results of market research, orders issued against the Multiple Award Contract will be set-aside for small businesses or any subcategory of small businesses whenever the \u201crule of two\u201d or any alternative set-aside requirements provided in the small business program have been met; or",
            "(B) The agency is preserving the right to consider set-asides using the \u201crule of two\u201d or any alternative set-aside requirements provided in the small business program, on an order-by-order basis.",
            "(iii) For the acquisition of orders valued at or below the simplified acquisition threshold (SAT), the contracting officer may set-aside the order for small businesses, 8(a) BD Participants, HUBZone SBCs, SDVO SBCs, WOSBs or EDWOSBs in accordance with the relevant program's regulations. For the acquisition of orders valued above the SAT, the contracting officer shall first consider whether there is a reasonable expectation that offers will be obtained from at least two 8(a) BD Participants, HUBZone SBCs, SDVO SBCs, WOSBs or EDWOSBs in accordance with the program's regulations, before setting aside the requirement as a small business set-aside. There is no order of precedence among the 8(a) BD, HUBZone, SDVO SBC or WOSB programs.",
            "(iv) The contracting officer must assign a NAICS code to the solicitation for each order issued against the Multiple Award Contract pursuant to \u00a7 121.402(c) of this chapter. See \u00a7 121.404 for further determination on size status for each order issued against that contract.",

            "(7) Partial set-aside and reserve. A procuring activity may have both a partial small business set-aside and a small business reserve on the same contract. A partial set-aside can be done for one or more CLINs that must be set-aside for small business and a reserve could also be done on the same procurement for other items or services where a contracting officer would have discretion to utilize the small business reserve where appropriate.",
            "(8) Tiered evaluation of offers, or cascading. An agency cannot create a tiered evaluation of offers or \u201ccascade\u201d unless it has specific statutory authority to do so. This is a procedure used in negotiated acquisitions when the contracting officer establishes a tiered or cascading order of precedence for evaluating offers that is specified in the solicitation, which states that if no award can be made at the first tier, it will evaluate offers at the next lower tier, until award can be made. For example, unless the agency has specific statutory authority to do so, an agency is not permitted to state an intention to award one contract to an 8(a) BD Participant and one to a HUBZone SBC, but only if no awards are made to 8(a) BD Participants.",
            "(f) Contracting Among Small Business Programs\u2014(1) Acquisitions Valued At or Below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold. The contracting officer shall set aside any acquisition with an anticipated dollar value exceeding the Micro-purchase Threshold but not exceeding the Simplified Acquisition Threshold (defined in the FAR at 48 CFR 2.101) for small business concerns when there is a reasonable expectation that offers will be obtained from at least two small business concerns that are competitive in terms of quality and delivery and award will be made at fair market prices. This requirement does not preclude a contracting officer from making an award to a small business under the 8(a) BD, HUBZone, SDVO SBC or WOSB Programs.",
            "(2) Acquisitions Valued Above the Simplified Acquisition Threshold. (i) The contracting officer shall set aside any acquisition with an anticipated dollar value exceeding the Simplified Acquisition Threshold (defined in the FAR at 48 CFR 2.101) for small business concerns when there is a reasonable expectation that offers will be obtained from at least two small business concerns that are competitive in terms of quality and delivery and award will be made at fair market prices. However, after conducting market research, the contracting officer shall first consider a set-aside or sole source award (if the sole source award is permitted by statute or regulation) under the 8(a) BD, HUBZone, SDVO SBC or WOSB programs before setting aside the requirement as a small business set-aside. There is no order of precedence among the 8(a) BD, HUBZone, SDVO SBC or WOSB programs. The contracting officer must document the contract file with the rationale used to support the specific set-aside, including the type and extent of market research conducted. In addition, the contracting officer must document the contract file showing that the apparent successful offeror's certifications in the System for Award Management (SAM) (or successor system) and associated representations were reviewed.",
            "(ii) SBA believes that Progress in fulfilling the various small business goals, as well as other factors such as the results of market research, programmatic needs specific to the procuring agency, anticipated award price, and the acquisition history, will be considered in making a decision as to which program to use for the acquisition.",
            "(g) Capabilities, past performance, and experience. When an offer of a small business prime contractor includes a proposed team of small business subcontractors and specifically identifies the first-tier subcontractor(s) in the proposal, the head of the agency must consider the capabilities, past performance, and experience of each first tier subcontractor that is part of the team as the capabilities, past performance, and experience of the small business prime contractor if the capabilities, past performance, and experience of the small business prime does not independently demonstrate capabilities and past performance necessary for award."

A contractor authorized to use a commercial subcontracting plan must include all indirect costs in its subcontracting goals and in its SSR;",
            "(v) The contractor must assign to each subcontract, and to each solicitation, if a solicitation is utilized, the NAICS code and corresponding size standard that best describes the principal purpose of the subcontract (see \u00a7 121.410 of this chapter).

Merely responding to a request for a quote does not constitute use in preparing a bid or offer. An offeror used a small business concern in preparing the bid or proposal if:",

All other concerns as to whether a prime contractor or subcontractor has complied with SBA regulations or otherwise acted in bad faith may be reported to the Government Contracting Area Office where the firm is headquartered.",
            "(d) Contracting officer responsibilities. The contracting officer (or administrative contracting officer if specifically delegated in writing to accomplish this task) is responsible for evaluating the prime contractor's compliance with its subcontracting plan, including:",

The same ratings criteria set forth in paragraph (f)(3) of this section apply to contractors with commercial plans.",
            "(7) SBA is authorized to enter into agreements with other Federal agencies or entities to conduct compliance reviews and otherwise further the objectives of the subcontracting program.

            "(a) General. (1) The Certificate of Competency (COC) Program is authorized under section 8(b)(7) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(b)(7)). The COC Program is applicable to all Government procurement actions, with the exception of 8(a) sole source awards but including Multiple Award Contracts and orders placed against Multiple Award Contracts, where the contracting officer has used any issues of capacity or credit (responsibility) to determine suitability for an award. The COC Program is applicable to all Government procurement actions, including Multiple Award Contracts and orders placed against Multiple Award Contracts, where the contracting officer has used any issues of capacity or credit (responsibility) to determine suitability for an award. With respect to Multiple Award Contracts, contracting officers generally determine responsibility at the time of award of the contract. However, if a contracting officer makes a responsibility determination as set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section for an order issued against a Multiple Award Contract, the contracting officer must refer the matter to SBA for a COC. The COC procedures apply to all Federal procurements, regardless of the location of performance or the location of the procuring activity.",

            "(iii) Refuses to consider a small business concern for award of a contract or order because it failed to meet a definitive responsibility criterion contained in the solicitation.",
            "(3) A small business offeror referred to SBA as nonresponsible may apply to SBA for a COC. Where the applicant is a non-manufacturing offeror on a supply contract, the COC applies to the responsibility of the non-manufacturer, not to that of the manufacturer.",
            "(b) COC Eligibility. (1) The offeror seeking a COC has the burden of proof to demonstrate its eligibility for COC review. (i) To be eligible for a COC, an offeror must qualify as a small business under the applicable size standard in accordance with part 121 of this chapter.",
            "(ii) To be eligible for a COC, an offeror must qualify as a small business under the applicable size standard in accordance with part 121 of this chapter, and must have agreed to comply with the applicable limitations on subcontracting and the nonmanufacturer rule, where applicable.",

            "(d) Application for COC. (1) Upon receipt of the contracting officer's referral, the Area Office will inform the concern of the contracting officer's negative responsibility determination, and offer it the opportunity to apply to SBA for a COC by a specified date.",
            "(2) The COC application must include all information and documentation requested by SBA and any additional information which the firm believes will demonstrate its ability to perform on the proposed contract. The application should be returned as soon as possible, but no later than the date specified by SBA.",
            "(3) Upon receipt of a complete and acceptable application, SBA may elect to visit the applicant's facility to review its responsibility. SBA personnel may obtain clarification or confirmation of information provided by the applicant by directly contacting suppliers, financial institutions, and other third parties upon whom the applicant's responsibility depends.",
            "(e) Incomplete applications. If an application for a COC is materially incomplete or is not submitted by the date specified by SBA, SBA will close the case without issuing a COC and will notify the contracting officer and the concern with a declination letter.",
            "(f) Reviewing an application. (1) The COC review process is not limited to the areas of nonresponsibility cited by the contracting officer. SBA may, at its discretion, independently evaluate the COC applicant for all elements of responsibility, but it may presume responsibility exists as to elements other than those cited as deficient. SBA may deny a COC for reasons of nonresponsibility not originally cited by the contracting officer.",
            "(2) An offeror seeking a COC has the burden of proof to demonstrate that it possesses all relevant elements of responsibility and that it has overcome the contracting officer's objection(s).",
            "(3) A small business will be rebuttably presumed nonresponsible if any of the following circumstances are shown to exist:",
            "(i) Within three years before the application for a COC, the concern, or any of its principals, has been convicted of an offense or offenses that would constitute grounds for debarment or suspension under FAR subpart 9.4 (48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4), and the matter is still under the jurisdiction of a court (e.g., the principals of a concern are incarcerated, on probation or parole, or under a suspended sentence); or",
            "(ii) Within three years before the application for a COC, the concern or any of its principals has had a civil judgment entered against it or them for any reason that would constitute grounds for debarment or suspension under FAR subpart 9.4 (48 CFR part, subpart 9.4).",
            "(4) Where a contracting officer finds a concern to be non-responsible for reasons of financial capacity on an indefinite delivery or indefinite quantity task or delivery order contract, the Area Director will consider the firm's maximum financial capacity. If the Area Director issues a COC, it will be for a specific amount that is the limit of the firm's financial capacity for that contract. The contracting officer may subsequently determine to exceed the amount, but cannot deny the firm award of an order or contract on financial grounds if the firm has not reached the financial maximum the Area Director identified in the COC letter.",
            "(g) Decision by Area Director (\u201cDirector\u201d). After reviewing the information submitted by the applicant and the information gathered by SBA, the Area Director will make a determination, either final or recommended as set forth in the following chart:",
            "(h) Notification of intent to issue on a contract or order with a value between the simplified acquisition threshold and $25 million. Where the Director determines that a COC is warranted, he or she will notify the contracting officer (or the procurement official with the authority to accept SBA's decision) of the intent to issue a COC, and of the reasons for that decision, prior to issuing the COC. At the time of notification, the contracting officer or the procurement official with the authority to accept SBA's decision has the following options:",
            "(1) Accept the Director's decision to issue the COC and award the contract to the concern. The COC issuance letter will then be sent, including as an attachment a detailed rationale of the decision; or",
            "(2) Ask the Director to suspend the case for one of the following purposes:",
            "(i) To forward a detailed rationale for the decision to the contracting officer for review within a specified period of time;",
            "(ii) To afford the contracting officer the opportunity to meet with the Area Office to review all documentation contained in the case file;",
            "(iii) To submit any information which the contracting officer believes SBA has not considered (at which time, SBA will establish a new suspense date mutually agreeable to the contracting officer and SBA); or",
            "(iv) To permit resolution of an appeal by the contracting agency to SBA Headquarters under paragraph (i) of this section.",
            "(i) Appeals of Area Director determinations. For COC actions with a value exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold , contracting agencies may appeal a Director's decision to issue a COC to SBA Headquarters by filing an appeal with the Area Office processing the COC application. The Area Office must honor the request to appeal if the contracting officer agrees to withhold award until the appeal process is concluded. Without such an agreement from the contracting officer, the Director must issue the COC. When such an agreement has been obtained, the Area Office will immediately forward the case file to SBA Headquarters.",
            "(1) The intent of the appeal procedure is to allow the contracting agency the opportunity to submit to SBA Headquarters any documentation which the Area Office may not have considered.",
            "(2) SBA Headquarters will furnish written notice to the Director, OSDBU or OSBP of the procuring agency, with a copy to the contracting officer, that the case file has been received and that an appeal decision may be requested by an authorized official. If the contracting agency decides to file an appeal, it must notify SBA Headquarters through its Director, OSDBU, within 10 working days (or a time period agreed upon by both agencies) of its receipt of the notice under paragraph (h) of this section. The appeal and any supporting documentation must be filed within 10 working days (or a different time period agreed to by both agencies) after SBA receives the request for a formal appeal.",
            "(3) The SBA Director, Office of Government Contracting (D/GC) will make a final determination, in writing, to issue or to deny the COC.",
            "(j) Decision by SBA Headquarters where contract value exceeds $25 million. (1) Prior to taking final action, SBA Headquarters will contact the contracting agency at the secretariat level or agency equivalent and afford it the following options:",
            "(i) Ask SBA Headquarters to suspend the case so that the agency can meet with Headquarters personnel and review all documentation contained in the case file; or",
            "(ii) Submit to SBA Headquarters for evaluation any information which the contracting agency believes has not been considered.",
            "(2) After reviewing all available information, the AA/GC will make a final decision to either issue or deny the COC. If the AA/GC's decision is to deny the COC, the applicant and contracting agency will be informed in writing by the Area Office. If the decision is to issue the COC, a letter certifying the responsibility of the firm will be sent to the contracting agency by Headquarters and the applicant will be informed of such issuance by the Area Office. Except as set forth in paragraph (l) of this section, there can be no further appeal or reconsideration of the decision of the AA/GC.",
            "(k) Notification of denial of COC. The notification to an unsuccessful applicant following either an Area Director or a Headquarters denial of a COC will briefly state all reasons for denial and inform the applicant that a meeting may be requested with appropriate SBA personnel to discuss the denial. Upon receipt of a request for such a meeting, the appropriate SBA personnel will confer with the applicant and explain the reasons for SBA's action. The meeting does not constitute an opportunity to rebut the merits of the SBA's decision to deny the COC, and is for the sole purpose of giving the applicant the opportunity to correct deficiencies so as to improve its ability to obtain future contracts either directly or, if necessary, through the issuance of a COC.",
            "(l) Reconsideration of COC after issuance. (1) An approved COC may be reconsidered and possibly rescinded, at the sole discretion of SBA, where an award of the contract has not occurred, and one of the following circumstances exists:",
            "(i) The COC applicant submitted false or omitted materially adverse information;",
            "(ii) New materially adverse information has been received relating to the current responsibility of the applicant concern; or",
            "(iii) The COC has been issued for more than 60 days (in which case SBA may investigate the business concern's current circumstances and the reason why the contract has not been issued).",
            "(2) Where SBA reconsiders and reaffirms the COC the procedures under paragraph (h) of this section do not apply.",
            "(m) Effect of a COC. By the terms of the Act, a COC is conclusive as to responsibility. Where SBA issues a COC on behalf of a small business with respect to a particular contract, contracting officers are required to award the contract without requiring the firm to meet any other requirement with respect to responsibility. Where SBA issues a COC with respect to a referral in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) or (a)(2)(iii) of this section, the contracting officer is not required to issue an award to that offeror if the contracting officer denies the contract for reasons unrelated to responsibility.",
            "(n) Effect of Denial of COC. Denial of a COC by SBA does not preclude a contracting officer from awarding a contract to the referred firm, nor does it prevent the concern from making an offer on any other procurement.",
            "(o) Monitoring performance. Once a COC has been issued and a contract awarded on that basis, SBA will monitor contractor performance."

Any work that a similarly situated subcontractor further subcontracts will count towards the 50% subcontract amount that cannot be exceeded. Other direct costs may be excluded to the extent they are not the principal purpose of the acquisition and small business concerns do not provide the service, such as airline travel, work performed by a transportation or disposal entity under a contract assigned the environmental remediation NAICS code (562910), cloud computing services, or mass media purchases. In addition, work performed overseas on awards made pursuant to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 or work required to be performed by a local contractor, is excluded.",

Any work that a similarly situated subcontractor further subcontracts will count towards the 50% subcontract amount that cannot be exceeded. Cost of materials are excluded and not considered to be subcontracted.",
            "(ii) In the case of a contract for supplies from a nonmanufacturer, it will supply the product of a domestic small business manufacturer or processor, unless a waiver as described in \u00a7 121.406(b)(5) of this chapter is granted.",
            "(A) For a multiple item procurement where a waiver as described in \u00a7 121.406(b)(5) of this chapter has not been granted for one or more items, more than 50% of the value of the products to be supplied by the nonmanufacturer must be the products of one or more domestic small business manufacturers or processors.",
            "(B) For a multiple item procurement where a waiver as described in \u00a7 121.406(b)(5) of this chapter is granted for one or more items, compliance with the limitation on subcontracting requirement will be determined by combining the value of the items supplied by domestic small business manufacturers or processors with the value of the items subject to a waiver. As such, as long as the value of the items to be supplied by domestic small business manufacturers or processors plus the value of the items to be supplied that are subject to a waiver account for at least 50% of the value of the contract, the limitations on subcontracting requirement is met.",
            "(C) For a multiple item procurement, the same small business concern may act as both a manufacturer and a nonmanufacturer.",
            "(3) In the case of a contract for general construction, it will not pay more than 85% of the amount paid by the government to it to firms that are not similarly situated. Any work that a similarly situated subcontractor further subcontracts will count towards the 85% subcontract amount that cannot be exceeded. Cost of materials are excluded and not considered to be subcontracted.",
            "(4) In the case of a contract for special trade contractors, no more than 75% of the amount paid by the government to the prime may be paid to firms that are not similarly situated. Any work that a similarly situated subcontractor further subcontracts will count towards the 75% subcontract amount that cannot be exceeded. Cost of materials are excluded and not considered to be subcontracted.",
            "(b) Mixed contracts. Where a contract integrates any combination of services, supplies, or construction, the contracting officer shall select the appropriate NAICS code as prescribed in \u00a7 121.402(b) of this chapter. The contracting officer's selection of the applicable NAICS code is determinative as to which limitation on subcontracting and performance requirement applies. Based on the NAICS code selected, the relevant limitation on subcontracting requirement identified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section will apply only to that portion of the contract award amount. In no case shall more than one limitation on subcontracting requirement apply to the same contract.",
            "(c) Subcontracts to similarly situated entities. A small business concern prime contractor that receives a contract listed in paragraph (a) of this section and spends contract amounts on a subcontractor that is a similarly situated entity shall not consider those subcontracted amounts as subcontracted for purposes of determining whether the small business concern prime contractor has violated paragraph (a) of this section, to the extent the subcontractor performs the work with its own employees. Any work that the similarly situated subcontractor does not perform with its own employees shall be considered subcontracted. SBA will also exclude a subcontract to a similarly situated entity from consideration under the ostensible subcontractor rule (\u00a7 121.103(h)(3)). A prime contractor may no longer count a similarly situated entity towards compliance with the limitations on subcontracting where the subcontractor ceases to qualify as small or under the relevant socioeconomic status.",
            "(d) Determining compliance with applicable limitation on subcontracting. The period of time used to determine compliance for a total or partial set-aside contract will generally be the base term and then each subsequent option period. However, for a multi-agency set aside contract where more than one agency can issue orders under the contract, the ordering agency must use the period of performance for each order to determine compliance and monitor compliance with the limitations on subcontracting for that specific order. At the end of performance of the order, the ordering contracting officer should then inform the contracting officer for the underlying multi-agency contract if the ordering contracting officer knows that the contractor has failed to meet the applicable limitations on subcontracting requirement. For an order set aside under a full and open contract or a full and open contract with reserve, the agency will use the period of performance for each order to determine compliance unless the order is competed among small and other-than-small businesses (in which case the subcontracting limitations will not apply).",
            "(1) The contracting officer, in his or her discretion, may require the concern to comply with the applicable limitations on subcontracting and the nonmanufacturer rule for each order awarded under a total or partial set-aside contract.",
            "(2) Compliance will be considered an element of responsibility and not a component of size eligibility.",
            "(3) Work performed by an independent contractor shall be considered a subcontract, and may count toward meeting the applicable limitation on subcontracting where the independent contractor qualifies as a similarly situated entity. Except with respect to staffing contracts, work performed by an employee obtained from a temporary employee agency, professional employer organization, or leasing concern shall be treated as the recipient concern's self-performance. The work performed by employees leased to the small business prime contractor will therefore not count against the applicable limitation on subcontracting.",
            "(e) Past Performance Evaluation. Where an agency determines that a contractor has not met the applicable limitation on subcontracting requirement at the conclusion of contract performance, the agency must notify the business concern and give it the opportunity to explain any extenuating or mitigating circumstances that negatively impacted its ability to do so.",
            "(1) Where a small business does not provide any extenuating or mitigating circumstances or the agency determines that the concern's failure to meet the applicable limitation on subcontracting requirement was not beyond the concern's control, the agency may not give a satisfactory or higher past performance rating for the appropriate factor or subfactor in accordance with FAR 42.1503.",
            "(2) Where a contracting officer determines that extenuating circumstances warrant a satisfactory/positive past performance evaluation for the appropriate evaluation factor or subfactor and the individual at least one level above the contracting officer concurs with that determination, a satisfactory or higher past performance rating may be given.",
            "(i) Extenuating or mitigating circumstances that could lead to a satisfactory/positive rating include, but are not limited to, unforeseen labor shortages, modifications to the contract's scope of work which were requested or directed by the Government, emergency or rapid response requirements that demand immediate subcontracting actions by the prime small business concern, unexpected changes to a subcontractor's designation as a similarly situated entity (as defined in \u00a7 125.1), differing site or environmental conditions which arose during the course of performance, force majeure events, and the contractor's good faith reliance upon a similarly situated subcontractor's representation of size or relevant socioeconomic status.",
            "(ii) An agency cannot rely on any circumstances that were within the contractor's control, or those which could have been mitigated without imposing an undue cost or burden on the contractor.",
            "(f) Inapplicability of limitations on subcontracting. The limitations on subcontracting do not apply to:",
            "(1) Small business set-aside contracts with a value that is greater than the micro-purchase threshold but less than or equal to the simplified acquisition threshold (as both terms are defined in the FAR at 48 CFR 2.101); or",
            "(2) Subcontracts (except where a prime is relying on a similarly situated entity to meet the applicable limitations on subcontracting).",
            "(3) For contracts where an independent contractor is not otherwise treated as an employee of the concern for which he/she is performing work for size purposes under \u00a7 121.106(a) of this chapter, work performed by the independent contractor shall be considered a subcontract. Such work will count toward meeting the applicable limitation on subcontracting where the independent contractor qualifies as a similarly situated entity.",
            "(4) Contracting officers may, at their discretion, require the contractor to demonstrate its compliance with the limitations on subcontracting at any time during performance and upon completion of a contract if the information regarding such compliance is not already available to the contracting officer. Evidence of compliance includes, but is not limited to, invoices, copies of subcontracts, or a list of the value of tasks performed.",
            "(g) Request to change applicable limitation on subcontracting. SBA may use different percentages if the Administrator determines that such action is necessary to reflect conventional industry practices among small business concerns that are below the numerical size standard for businesses in that industry group. Representatives of a national trade or industry group or any interested SBC may request a change in subcontracting percentage requirements for the categories defined by six digit industry codes in the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) pursuant to the following procedures:",
            "(1) Format of request. Requests from representatives of a trade or industry group and interested SBCs should be in writing and sent or delivered to the Director, Office of Government Contracting, U.S. Small Business Administration, 409 3rd Street SW., Washington, DC 20416. The requester must demonstrate to SBA that a change in percentage is necessary to reflect conventional industry practices among small business concerns that are below the numerical size standard for businesses in that industry category, and must support its request with information including, but not limited to:",
            "(i) Information relative to the economic conditions and structure of the entire national industry;",
            "(ii) Market data, technical changes in the industry and industry trends;",
            "(iii) Specific reasons and justifications for the change in the subcontracting percentage;",

Upon an adequate preliminary showing to SBA, SBA will publish in the Federal Register a notice of its receipt of a request that it considers a change in the subcontracting percentage requirements for a particular industry. The notice will identify the group making the request, and give the public an opportunity to submit information and arguments in both support and opposition.",
            "(3) Comments. SBA will provide a period of not less than 30 days for public comment in response to the Federal Register notice.",
            "(4) Decision. SBA will render its decision after the close of the comment period. If SBA decides against a change, SBA will publish notice of its decision in the Federal Register.

A party's failure to comply with the spirit and intent of a subcontract with a similarly situated entity may be considered a basis for debarment on the grounds, including but not limited to, that the parties have violated the terms of a Government contract or subcontract pursuant to FAR 9.406-2(b)(1)(i) (48 CFR 9.406-2(b)(1)(i))."

A joint venture of two or more business concerns may submit an offer as a small business for a Federal procurement, subcontract or sale so long as each concern is small under the size standard corresponding to the NAICS code assigned to the contract, or qualify as small under one of the exceptions to affiliation set forth in \u00a7 121.103(b) of this chapter.",

The joint venture agreement may not give to a non-managing venturer negative control over activities of the joint venture, unless those provisions would otherwise be commercially customary for a joint venture agreement for a government contract outside of SBA's programs. A non-managing venturer's approval may be required in, among other things, determining what contract opportunities the joint venture should seek and initiating litigation on behalf of the joint venture.",

            "(3) The amount of work done by the partners will be aggregated and the work done by the small business prot\u00e9g\u00e9 partner must be at least 40% of the total done by the partners. In determining the amount of work done by a mentor participating in a joint venture with a small business prot\u00e9g\u00e9, all work done by the mentor and any of its affiliates at any subcontracting tier will be counted.",
            "(4) Work performed by a similarly situated entity will not count toward the requirement that a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 must perform at least 40% of the work performed by a joint venture.",

Prior to the performance of any contract set aside or reserved for small business by a joint venture between a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 small business and a mentor authorized by \u00a7 125.9, the small business partner to the joint venture must submit a written certification to the contracting officer and SBA, signed by an authorized official of each partner to the joint venture, stating as follows:",

            "(e) Capabilities, past performance and experience. When evaluating the capabilities, past performance, experience, business systems and certifications of an entity submitting an offer for a contract set aside or reserved for small business as a joint venture established pursuant to this section, a procuring activity must consider work done and qualifications held individually by each partner to the joint venture as well as any work done by the joint venture itself previously.",
            "(1) A procuring activity has discretion whether to require a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 or lead small business member of a joint venture to demonstrate some level of past performance and/or experience. It may rely solely on the past performance and experience of the mentor or non-similarly situated joint venture partner, or it may require some level of past performance and/or experience of the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 or lead small business member. Where it requires some level of past performance and/or experience of the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 or lead small business firm, the procuring activity shall not require that firm to individually meet all the same evaluation or responsibility criteria as that required of other offerors generally.",
            "(2) If a procuring activity requires a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 or lead small business joint venture partner to demonstrate some successful performance and/or experience on fewer previous contracts of lower values than that required of other offerors generally, successful performance by the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 or lead small business firm on the contracts it identifies shall be rated equivalently to successful performance by the mentor or non-similarly situated partner to the joint venture or any other individual offeror on the higher valued contracts they identify.",
            "(3) The partners to the joint venture in the aggregate must demonstrate the past performance, experience, business systems and certifications necessary to perform the contract.",
            "(f) Contract execution. The procuring activity will execute a contract set aside or reserved for small business in the name of the joint venture entity when there is a separate legal entity joint venture or the name of a small business partner to the joint venture when there is an informal joint venture, but in either case will identify the award as one to a small business joint venture or a small business mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 joint venture, as appropriate.",
            "(g) Inspection of records. The joint venture partners must allow SBA's authorized representatives, including representatives authorized by the SBA Inspector General, during normal business hours, access to its files to inspect and copy all records and documents relating to the joint venture.",
            "(h) Performance of work reports. In connection with any contract set aside or reserved for small business that is awarded to a joint venture between a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 small business and a mentor authorized by \u00a7 125.9, the small business partner must describe how it is meeting or has met the applicable performance of work requirements for each contract set aside or reserved for small business that it performs as a joint venture.",
            "(1) The small business partner to the joint venture must annually submit a report to the relevant contracting officer and to the SBA, signed by an authorized official of each partner to the joint venture, explaining how the performance of work requirements are being met for each contract set aside or reserved for small business that is performed during the year.",
            "(2) At the completion of every contract set aside or reserved for small business that is awarded to a joint venture between a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 small business and a mentor authorized by \u00a7 125.9, and upon request by SBA or the relevant contracting officer prior to contract completion, the small business partner to the joint venture must submit a report to the relevant contracting officer and to SBA, signed by an authorized official of each partner to the joint venture, explaining how and certifying that the performance of work requirements were met for the contract, and further certifying that the contract was performed in accordance with the provisions of the joint venture agreement that are required under paragraph (b) of this section.",
            "(i) Basis for suspension or debarment. For any joint venture between a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 small business and a mentor authorized by \u00a7 125.9, the Government may consider the following as a ground for suspension or debarment as a willful violation of a regulatory provision or requirement applicable to a public agreement or transaction:",
            "(1) Failure to enter a joint venture agreement that complies with paragraph (b) of this section;",
            "(2) Failure to perform a contract in accordance with the joint venture agreement or performance of work requirements in paragraph (c) of this section; or",
            "(3) Failure to submit the certification required by paragraph (d) of this section or comply with paragraph (g) of this section.",
            "(j) Compliance with performance of work requirements. Any person with information concerning a joint venture's compliance with the performance of work requirements may report that information to SBA and/or the SBA Office of Inspector General."

            "(a) General. The small business mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 program is designed to enhance the capabilities of prot\u00e9g\u00e9 firms by requiring approved mentors to provide business development assistance to prot\u00e9g\u00e9 firms and to improve the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 firms' ability to successfully compete for federal contracts. This assistance may include technical and/or management assistance; financial assistance in the form of equity investments and/or loans; subcontracts (either from the mentor to the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 or from the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to the mentor); trade education; and/or assistance in performing prime contracts with the Government through joint venture arrangements. Mentors are encouraged to provide assistance relating to the performance of contracts set aside or reserved for small business so that prot\u00e9g\u00e9 firms may more fully develop their capabilities.",
            "(b) Mentors. Any for-profit business concern that demonstrates a commitment and the ability to assist small business concerns may act as a mentor and receive benefits as set forth in this section. This includes other than small businesses.",
            "(1) In order to qualify as a mentor, a concern must demonstrate that it:",

            "(iii) Can impart value to a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 firm due to lessons learned and practical experience gained or through its knowledge of general business operations and government contracting.",
            "(2) (i) SBA will decline an application if SBA determines that the mentor does not possess good character or a favorable financial position, employs or otherwise controls the managers or key employees of the prot\u00e9g\u00e9, or is otherwise affiliated with the prot\u00e9g\u00e9.",
            "(ii) SBA may terminate the mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreement if:",
            "(A) SBA determines that the mentor does not possess good character or a favorable financial position;",
            "(B) SBA determines that the mentor was affiliated with the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 at the time of application or becomes affiliated with the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 for reasons other than the mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreement or assistance provided under the agreement; or",
            "(C) Key managers or personnel become employees of both the mentor and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 firms at the same time.",

            "(i) A mentor that has more than one prot\u00e9g\u00e9 cannot submit competing offers in response to a solicitation for a specific procurement through separate joint ventures with different prot\u00e9g\u00e9s.",
            "(ii) A mentor (including in the aggregate a parent company and all of its subsidiaries) generally cannot have more than three prot\u00e9g\u00e9s at one time.",
            "(A) The first two mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationships approved by SBA between a specific mentor and a small business that has its principal office located in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico do not count against the limit of three proteges that a mentor can have at one time.",
            "(B) Where a mentor purchases another business entity that is also an SBA-approved mentor of one or more prot\u00e9g\u00e9 small business concerns and the purchasing mentor commits to honoring the obligations under the seller's mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreement(s), that entity may have more than three prot\u00e9g\u00e9s (i.e., those of the purchased concern in addition to those of its own). In such a case, the entity could not add another prot\u00e9g\u00e9 until it fell below three in total.",
            "(4) A mentor cannot be a contract holder through joint ventures with two prot\u00e9g\u00e9 small business concerns on the same small business multiple award contract or small business reserve on a multiple award contract at the same time.",
            "(i) Where a mentor purchases another business entity that is also an SBA-approved mentor that is a contract holder as a joint venture with a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 small business and the mentor is also a contract holder with a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 small business on that same multiple award contract, the mentor must exit one of those joint venture relationships.",
            "(ii) The prot\u00e9g\u00e9 firm connected to the joint venture from which the mentor exits may seek to:",
            "(A) Acquire the new mentor's interest in the small business multiple award contract or reserve and, where necessary and appropriate, novate such contract or reserve to itself only pursuant to FAR 42.1204; or",
            "(B) Replace the new mentor with another business in the joint venture such that the revised joint venture will continue to qualify as small and be eligible for orders issued under the multiple award contract.",
            "(C) SBA will not find affiliation where a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 obtains financing under normal commercial terms in order to purchase the mentor's interest in a multiple award contract.",
            "(c) Prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. (1) In order to initially qualify as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 firm, a concern must qualify as small for the size standard corresponding to its primary NAICS code or identify that it is seeking business development assistance with respect to a secondary NAICS code and qualify as small for the size standard corresponding to that NAICS code.",
            "(i) A firm may self-certify that it qualifies as small for its primary or identified secondary NAICS code.",
            "(ii) Where a small business concern seeks to qualify as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 in a secondary NAICS code, the concern must demonstrate how the mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationship will help it further develop or expand its current capabilities in that secondary NAICS code. SBA will not approve a mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationship in a secondary NAICS code in which the small business concern has no prior experience. SBA may approve a mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationship where the small business concern can demonstrate that it has performed work in one or more similar NAICS codes or where the NAICS code in which the small business concern seeks a mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationship is a logical business progression to work previously performed by the concern.",
            "(2) A prot\u00e9g\u00e9 firm may generally have only one mentor at a time.",
            "(i) SBA may approve a second mentor for a particular prot\u00e9g\u00e9 firm where the second relationship will not compete or otherwise conflict with the first mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationship, and:",
            "(A) The second relationship pertains to an unrelated NAICS code; or",
            "(B) The prot\u00e9g\u00e9 firm is seeking to acquire a specific expertise that the first mentor does not possess.",
            "(ii) Where SBA has approved two mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationships for the same prot\u00e9g\u00e9 small business, the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 may enter joint venture relationships with each of its two mentors. However, those joint ventures cannot compete against each other and cannot be contract holders on the same multiple award contract.",
            "(3) SBA may authorize a small business to be both a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and a mentor at the same time where the small business can demonstrate that the second relationship will not compete or otherwise conflict with the first mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationship.",
            "(4) A prot\u00e9g\u00e9 may generally have a total of two mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreements with different mentors.",
            "(i) Each mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreement may last for no more than six years, as set forth in paragraph (e)(5) of this section.",
            "(ii) If a mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreement is terminated within 18 months from the date SBA approved the agreement, that mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationship will generally not count as one of the two mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationships that a small business may enter as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9. However, where a specific small business prot\u00e9g\u00e9 appears to enter into many short-term mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationships as a means of extending its program eligibility as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9, SBA may determine that the business concern has exhausted its participation in the mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 program and not approve an additional mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationship.",
            "(iii) If during the evaluation of the mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationship pursuant to paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section SBA determines that a mentor has not provided the business development assistance set forth in its mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreement or that the quality of the assistance provided was not satisfactory, SBA may terminate the mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationship. Where SBA or the parties themselves terminate a mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationship, SBA may allow the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to substitute another mentor for the time remaining in the mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreement without counting against the two-mentor limit.",
            "(iv) Instead of having a six-year mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationship with two separate mentors, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 may seek to extend or renew a mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationship with the same mentor for a second six-year term. In order for SBA to approve an extension or renewal of a mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationship with the same mentor, the mentor must commit to providing additional business development assistance to the prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Whether a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 has a mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationship with two different mentors or the same mentor for a second six-year period, a concern cannot be a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 for a total of more than 12 years.",
            "(5) Where a business concern purchases another business concern that is currently the mentor of a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 firm, that business concern shall become the new mentor of the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 if it commits to honoring the obligations under the seller's mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreement or the purchasing business concern and the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 negotiate a new mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreement that SBA approves. Where that occurs, that new mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationship will be effective for no longer than six years minus the length of the mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationship with the seller mentor.",
            "(i) The prot\u00e9g\u00e9 firm can terminate its mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationship only if the purchasing business concern and the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 firm cannot agree on either continuing with the previous mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreement or negotiating a new mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreement that is acceptable to SBA.",
            "(ii) Where a mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationship is terminated, the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 firm may seek another business concern to enter a mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationship for a duration not to exceed six years minus the length of the mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationship with the former mentor.",
            "(d) Benefits. (1) A prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and mentor may joint venture as a small business for any government prime contract, subcontract or sale, provided the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 qualifies as small for the procurement or sale. Such a joint venture may seek any type of small business contract (i.e., small business set-aside, 8(a), HUBZone, SDVO, or WOSB) for which the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 firm qualifies (e.g., a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 firm that qualifies as a WOSB could seek a WOSB set-aside as a joint venture with its SBA-approved mentor). Similarly, a joint venture between a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and mentor may seek a subcontract as a HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, SDVO small business, or WOSB provided the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 individually qualifies as such.",
            "(i) SBA must approve the mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreement before the two firms may submit an offer as a joint venture on a particular government prime contract or subcontract in order for the joint venture to receive the exclusion from affiliation.",
            "(ii) In order to receive the exclusion from affiliation, the joint venture must meet the requirements set forth in \u00a7 125.8(b)(2), (c), and (d).",
            "(iii) A joint venture between a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and its mentor will qualify as a small business for any procurement for which the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 individually qualifies as small. Once a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 firm no longer qualifies as a small business for the size standard corresponding to the NAICS code under which SBA approved its mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationship, any joint venture between the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and its mentor will no longer be able to seek additional contracts or subcontracts as a small business for any NAICS code having the same or lower size standard. A joint venture between a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and its mentor could seek additional contract opportunities in NAICS codes having a size standard for which the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 continues to qualify as small. A change in the prot\u00e9g\u00e9's size status does not generally affect contracts previously awarded to a joint venture between the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and its mentor.",
            "(A) Except for contracts with durations of more than five years (including options), a contract awarded to a joint venture between a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and a mentor as a small business continues to qualify as an award to small business for the life of that contract and the joint venture remains obligated to continue performance on that contract.",
            "(B) For contracts with durations of more than five years (including options), where size re-certification is required under \u00a7 121.404(g)(3) of this chapter no more than 120 days prior to the end of the fifth year of the contract and no more than 120 days prior to exercising any option thereafter, once the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 no longer qualifies as small for the size standard corresponding to the NAICS code assigned to the contract, the joint venture will not be able re-certify itself to be a small business for that contract. The rules set forth in \u00a7 121.404(g)(3) of this chapter apply in such circumstances.",
            "(iv) Where a mentor seeks to sell its interest in a mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 joint venture, the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 firm shall have a right of first refusal to purchase that interest. SBA will not find affiliation where a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 obtains financing under normal commercial terms in order to purchase the mentor's interest in a mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 joint venture.",
            "(2) In order to raise capital, the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 firm may agree to sell or otherwise convey to the mentor an equity interest of up to 40% in the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 firm.",
            "(3) Notwithstanding the mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationship, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 firm may qualify for other assistance as a small business, including SBA financial assistance.",
            "(4) No determination of affiliation or control may be found between a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 firm and its mentor based solely on the mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreement or any assistance provided pursuant to the agreement. However, affiliation may be found for other reasons set forth in \u00a7 121.103 of this chapter.",
            "(5) Where appropriate, procuring activities may provide incentives in the contract evaluation process to a firm that will provide significant subcontracting work to its SBA-approved prot\u00e9g\u00e9 firm.",

            "(e) Written agreement. (1) The mentor and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 firms must enter a written agreement setting forth an assessment of the prot\u00e9g\u00e9's needs and providing a detailed description and timeline for the delivery of the assistance the mentor commits to provide to address those needs (e.g., management and or technical assistance; loans and/or equity investments; bonding; use of equipment; export assistance; assistance as a subcontractor under prime contracts being performed by the prot\u00e9g\u00e9; cooperation on joint venture projects; or subcontracts under prime contracts being performed by the mentor). The mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreement must:",
            "(i) Specifically identify the business development assistance to be provided and address how the assistance will help the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 enhance its growth and/or foster or acquire needed capabilities;",
            "(ii) Identify the specific entity or entities that will provide assistance to or participate in joint ventures with the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 where the mentor is a parent or subsidiary concern;",
            "(iii) Establish a single point of contact in the mentor concern who is responsible for managing and implementing the mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreement; and",
            "(iv) Provide that the mentor will provide such assistance to the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 firm for at least one year.",
            "(2) A firm seeking SBA's approval to be a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 must identify any other mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationship it has through another federal agency or SBA and provide a copy of each such mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreement to SBA.",
            "(i) The small business mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreement must identify how the assistance to be provided by the proposed mentor is different from assistance provided to the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 through another mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationship, either with the same or a different mentor.",
            "(ii) A firm seeking SBA's approval to be a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 may terminate a mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationship it has through another agency and use any not yet provided assistance identified in the other mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreement as part of the assistance that will be provided through the small business mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationship. Any assistance that has already been provided through another mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationship cannot be identified as assistance that will be provided through the small business mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationship.",
            "(3) The written agreement must be approved by the Associate Administrator for Business Development (AA/BD) or his/her designee. The agreement will not be approved if SBA determines that the assistance to be provided is not sufficient to promote any real developmental gains to the prot\u00e9g\u00e9, or if SBA determines that the agreement is merely a vehicle to enable the mentor to receive small business contracts.",
            "(4) The agreement must provide that either the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 or the mentor may terminate the agreement with 30 days advance notice to the other party to the mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationship and to SBA.",
            "(5) The term of a mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreement may not exceed six years. If an initial mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreement is for less than six years, it may be extended by mutual agreement prior to the expiration date for an additional amount of time that would total no more than six years from its inception (e.g., if the initial mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreement was for two years, it could be extended for an additional four years by consent of the two parties; if the initial mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreement was for three years, it could be extended for an additional three years by consent of the two parties). Unless rescinded in writing as a result of an SBA review, the mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationship will automatically renew without additional written notice of continuation or extension to the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 firm.",
            "(6) SBA must approve all changes to a mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreement in advance, and any changes made to the agreement must be provided in writing. If the parties to the mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationship change the mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreement without prior approval by SBA, SBA shall terminate the mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationship and may also propose suspension or debarment of one or both of the firms pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section where appropriate.",
            "(7) If control of the mentor changes (through a stock sale or otherwise), the previously approved mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationship may continue provided that, after the change in control, the mentor expresses in writing to SBA that it acknowledges the mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9agreement and certifies that it will continue to abide by its terms.",
            "(8) SBA may terminate the mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreement at any time if it determines that the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 is not benefiting from the relationship or that the parties are not complying with any term or condition of the mentor prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreement. In the event SBA terminates the relationship, the mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 joint venture is obligated to complete any previously awarded contracts unless the procuring agency issues a stop work order.",
            "(f) Decision to decline mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationship. Where SBA declines to approve a specific mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreement, SBA will issue a written decision setting forth its reason(s) for the decline. The small business concern seeking to be a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 cannot attempt to enter into another mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationship with the same mentor for a period of 60 calendar days from the date of the final decision. The small business concern may, however, submit another proposed mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreement with a different proposed mentor at any time after the SBA's final decline decision.",
            "(g) Evaluating the mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationship. SBA will review the mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationship annually. SBA will ask the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 for its assessment of how the mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationship is working, whether or not the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 received the agreed upon business development assistance, and whether the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 would recommend the mentor to be a mentor for another small business in the future. At any point in the mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationship where a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 believes that a mentor has not provided the business development assistance set forth in its mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreement or that the quality of the assistance provided did not meet its expectations, the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 can ask SBA to intervene on its behalf with the mentor.",
            "(1) Within 30 days of the anniversary of SBA's approval of the mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreement, the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 must report to SBA for the preceding year:",
            "(i) All technical and/or management assistance provided by the mentor to the prot\u00e9g\u00e9;",
            "(ii) All loans to and/or equity investments made by the mentor in the prot\u00e9g\u00e9;",
            "(iii) All subcontracts awarded to the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 by the mentor and all subcontracts awarded to the mentor by the prot\u00e9g\u00e9, and the value of each subcontract;",
            "(iv) All federal contracts awarded to the mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationship as a joint venture (designating each as a small business set-aside, small business reserve, or unrestricted procurement), the value of each contract, and the percentage of the contract performed and the percentage of revenue accruing to each party to the joint venture; and",
            "(v) A narrative describing the success such assistance has had in addressing the developmental needs of the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and addressing any problems encountered.",
            "(2) The prot\u00e9g\u00e9 must report the mentoring services it receives by category and hours.",
            "(3) The prot\u00e9g\u00e9 must annually certify to SBA whether there has been any change in the terms of the agreement.",
            "(4) At any point in the mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationship where a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 believes that a mentor has not provided the business development assistance set forth in its mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreement or that the quality of the assistance provided did not meet its expectations, the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 can ask SBA to intervene on its behalf with the mentor.",
            "(5) SBA may decide not to approve continuation of a mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreement where:",
            "(i) SBA finds that the mentor has not provided the assistance set forth in the mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreement;",
            "(ii) SBA finds that the assistance provided by the mentor has not resulted in any material benefits or developmental gains to the prot\u00e9g\u00e9; or",

            "(h) Consequences of not providing assistance set forth in the mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreement. (1) Where SBA determines that a mentor may not have provided to the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 firm the business development assistance set forth in its mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreement or that the quality of the assistance provided may not have been satisfactory, SBA will notify the mentor of such determination and afford the mentor an opportunity to respond. The mentor must respond within 30 days of the notification, presenting information demonstrating that it did satisfactorily provide the assistance set forth in the mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreement or explaining why it has not provided the agreed upon assistance and setting forth a definitive plan as to when it will provide such assistance. If the mentor fails to respond, does not adequately provide information demonstrating that it did satisfactorily provide the assistance set forth in the mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreement, does not supply adequate reasons for its failure to provide the agreed upon assistance, or does not set forth a definite plan to provide the assistance:",
            "(i) SBA will terminate the mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreement;",
            "(ii) The firm will be ineligible to again act as a mentor for a period of two years from the date SBA terminates the mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreement; and",
            "(iii) SBA may recommend to the relevant procuring agency to issue a stop work order for each federal contract for which the mentor and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 are performing as a small business joint venture in order to encourage the mentor to comply with its mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreement. Where a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 firm is able to independently complete performance of any such contract, SBA may recommend to the procuring agency to authorize a substitution of the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 firm for the joint venture.",
            "(2) SBA may consider a mentor's failure to comply with the terms and conditions of an SBA-approved mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreement as a basis for debarment on the grounds, including but not limited to, that the mentor has not complied with the terms of a public agreement under 2 CFR 180.800(b).",
            "(i) Results of mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationship. (1) In order to assess the results of a mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationship upon its completion, the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 must report to SBA whether it believed the mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationship was beneficial and describe any lasting benefits to the prot\u00e9g\u00e9.",
            "(2) Where a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 does not report the results of a mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationship upon its completion, SBA will not approve a second mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationship either under this section or under \u00a7 124.520 of this chapter."

Size or status recertification is not required when the ownership of a concern that is at least 51% owned by an Indian Tribe, Alaska Native Corporation, or Community Development Corporation changes to or from a wholly-owned business concern of the same entity, as long as the ultimate owner remains that entity.",
            "(e) Effect of Recertification\u2014(1) Qualifying Recertification. A concern that has a qualifying recertification is generally considered to be a small business or small business program participant for up to five years from the date of the recertification and remains eligible for set-aside or reserved awards unless there is a subsequent disqualifying recertification.",
            "(2) Disqualifying Recertification\u2014(i) Pending Set Aside or Reserved Award. If events triggering a disqualifying recertification under paragraph (a) of this section occur within 180 days after the date of an offer but prior to award, the concern is ineligible to receive the pending small business set aside or reserved award. The concern must notify the contracting officer of the change in its size or status. If events triggering a disqualifying recertification under paragraph (a) of this section occur more than 180 days after the date of an offer but prior to award, the concern is eligible to receive a pending single award or reserve and the award will count as an award to a small business or small business program participant for goaling purposes for up to five years from the date of the award unless there is a disqualifying recertification. However, where the underlying award is a multiple award small business set aside or reserve the concern is ineligible for the pending award because the concern would not be eligible for orders set aside for small business or set aside for a specific type of small business. See paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(B) of this section.",
            "(ii) Future Set Aside or Reserved Award\u2014(A) Request for recertification on a specific order or agreement under an underlying multiple award contract that is set aside or reserved for small business. If a concern has a disqualifying size or status recertification in response to a contracting officer request for recertification on a specific order or agreement under an underlying multiple award contract that is set aside or reserved for small business (i.e., small business set-aside or reserve, 8(a) small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, or women-owned/economically disadvantaged women-owned small business), the concern is ineligible for the specific order or agreement but remains eligible for other set aside or reserved awards and unrestricted awards.",
            "(1) Where an initially-small contract holder has naturally grown to be other than small and could not recertify as small for a specific order or agreement for which a contracting officer requested recertification, it may continue to qualify as small for other orders or agreements where a contracting officer does not request recertification.",
            "(2) Where an initially-eligible 8(a), HUBZone, WOSB or SDVOSB contract holder on an 8(a), HUBZone, WOSB or SDVOSB set-aside or reserve cannot recertify its status for a specific order or agreement for which a contracting officer requested recertification, it may continue to qualify as eligible for other competitively awarded orders or agreements where a contracting officer does not request recertification.",
            "(B) Other Events Triggering Recertification. (1) If a concern has a disqualifying recertification in response to a recertification requirement on a long-term multiple award contract or a recertification requirement following a merger, acquisition, or sale involving a business entity that does not itself qualify as small under the NAICS code assigned to the multiple award contract, the concern is ineligible to submit an offer for a set aside or reserved award after the triggering event occurs. The concern remains eligible for unrestricted awards under a multiple award contract and orders issued under a single award small business contract. In either case, a procuring agency cannot count the order as an award to small business or to the specific type of small business (i.e., 8(a), WOSB, SDVOSB, or HUBZone).",
            "(2) If a concern has a disqualifying recertification in response to a requirement to recertify size and/or status following a merger, acquisition, or sale involving another small business concern, the concern remains eligible for set-aside or reserved orders issued under a multiple award contract, but a procuring agency cannot count the order as an award to small business or to the specific type of small business (i.e., 8(a), WOSB, SDVOSB, or HUBZone).",
            "(iii) Options. (A) For a single award small business set-aside or reserve award or any unrestricted award, a concern that submits a disqualifying recertification remains eligible to receive options. The procuring agency cannot count the option period as an award to a small business or small business program participant for goaling purposes. Such a concern may make a qualifying recertification for a subsequent option period if it meets the applicable size standard or becomes a certified small business program participant.",
            "(B) For a multiple award contract that is set-aside or reserved for small business, a concern that submits a disqualifying recertification in response to a recertification requirement on a long-term contract or a recertification requirement following a merger, acquisition, or sale involving a business entity that does not itself qualify as small under the NAICS code assigned to the multiple award contract is ineligible to receive options.",
            "(C) For a multiple award contract that is set-aside or reserved for small business, a concern that submits a disqualifying recertification in response to a requirement to recertify size and/or status following a merger, acquisition, or sale involving another small business concern, the concern remains eligible to receive options. The procuring agency cannot count the option period as an award to a small business or to the specific type of small business (i.e., 8(a), WOSB, SDVOSB, or HUBZone). Such a concern may make a qualifying recertification for a subsequent option period if it meets the applicable size standard or becomes a certified small business program participant.",
            "(f) Joint venture recertifications. Where a joint venture must recertify its small business size status under paragraph (a) of this section, the joint venture can recertify as small where all parties to the joint venture qualify as small at the time of recertification, or the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 small business in a still active mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 joint venture qualifies as small at the time of recertification. A joint venture can recertify as small even though the date of recertification occurs more than two years after the joint venture received its first contract award (i.e., recertification is not considered a new contract award under \u00a7 121.103(h).",
            "(g) Delayed effective date. Notwithstanding paragraphs (e)(2)(ii)(B) and (e)(2)(iii)(B) of this section:",
            "(1) A firm that has a disqualifying size or status recertification due to a merger, acquisition or sale that occurs prior to January 17, 2026 remains eligible for orders issued under an underlying small business multiple award contract. However, the agency cannot count any new or pending orders issued pursuant to the contract, from that point forward, towards its small business and socioeconomic goals. This includes set-asides, partial set-asides, and reserves for 8(a) BD Participants, certified HUBZone small business concerns, SDVO SBCs, and ED/WOSBs.",
            "(2) A firm that has a disqualifying size or status recertification prior to the end of the fifth year of a long-term contract remains eligible for any options to be exercised prior to January 17, 2026. However, the agency cannot count those options towards its small business and socioeconomic goals."

(1) Where the recipient organization is an educational institution, the salaries of the SBDC Lead Center Director and the SBDC Service Center Director at a minimum must approximate the average annualized salary of a full professor and an assistant professor, respectively, in the school or department in which the SBDC is located. If a recipient organization is not an educational institution, the salaries of the SBDC Lead Center Director and the subcenter Directors must approximate the average salaries of parallel positions within the recipient organization. In both cases, the recipient organization should consider the Director's longevity in the Program, the number of subcenters, the size of the SBDC budget, the number of service centers, and the individual's experience and background when determining the salary.",
            "(2) Salaries for Lead Center Directors should be comparable to salaries paid Lead Center Directors in other states or regions with comparably sized programs, responsibilities, and authority.",

(1) All travel must be separately identified in the proposed budget under the categories of: planned in-state/region, planned out-of-state/region, unanticipated in-state/region, or unanticipated out-of-state/region. Unplanned travel estimates may be based on the SBDC's experience.",
            "(2) Transportation costs must be justified in writing, including the estimated cost, number of persons traveling, and the benefit to be derived by the small business community from the proposed travel.",
            "(3) Any proposed unplanned out-of-state/region travel exceeding the approved amount budgeted for this category must be submitted to the SBA for approval on a case-by-case basis prior to traveling.",
            "(4) All foreign travel requests must be submitted to the appropriate District Director and the SBDC Program Manager for review and provided to the AA/SBDC for final approval in accordance with the notice of funding opportunity. Foreign travel charged to the SBDC cooperative agreement or performed by SBDC staff, while on duty for the recipient organization, must be approved in advance.",
            "(i) Planned foreign travel costs allocable to the SBDC cooperative agreement for SBDC network staff may be approved by AA/SBDC through the annual proposal process, but such planned costs must be fully disclosed and justified in the budget narrative for Agency review. Prior approval should be obtained from the AA/SBDC prior to travel in accordance with 2 CFR part 200.",
            "(ii) Unanticipated foreign travel must be approved using the process set forth in this paragraph (h)."

The Grants Management Officer will respond in writing to the recipient organization within 30 calendar days of receipt of the descriptive statement.",

Copies of the decision will be provided to the recipient organization, the AA/SBDC, the Grants Management Specialist, and the SBA Project Officer.",
            "(9) Where a recipient organization's appeal to the Committee commences or is pending within 120 days of the end of the current budget period, the recipient organization has the right to request, in writing, that the matter be handled under an expedited appeal process. In such circumstances, the Committee, by an affirmative vote of its membership, may expedite the appeals process to attain final resolution of a dispute before the anticipated issuance date of a new cooperative agreement.",
            "(b) Programmatic (non-financial) disputes. (1) The SBDC Lead Center and the SBA District Office must make every effort to resolve any disputes that arise between the SBDC network and SBA involving non-financial, programmatic issues. If the recipient organization is not satisfied with the resolution, it may, by written request to the AA/SBDC, seek reconsideration of the programmatic dispute within 30 calendar days. When a recipient organization requests reconsideration of a programmatic dispute, the appropriate Program Manager will forward a written summary of the dispute, including comments from the SBDC Lead Center Director, the SBA District Office, and all other pertinent background information to the AA/SBDC within 15 calendar days of SBA's receipt of the request.",

            "(1) Non-renewal. The AA/SBDC may elect not to renew a cooperative agreement with a recipient organization at any point. In undertaking a nonrenewal action, the AA/SBDC may either choose not to accept or consider any application for renewal from the recipient organization or the Agency may choose not to exercise option years remaining under the cooperative agreement. When a cooperative agreement is not renewed, the recipient organization may continue to conduct project activities and incur allowable expenses until the end of the current budget period. If a recipient organization decides to not seek to renew its grant, it must notify the District Office and send a letter of intent to withdraw to the AA/SBDC as soon as it is feasible.",
            "(2) Suspension. (i) The AA/SBDC may suspend a cooperative agreement with a recipient organization at any point. A decision to suspend a cooperative agreement is effective immediately. The suspension of a recipient organization begins on the date the notice of suspension is issued, and the period of suspension will last no longer than six months. At the end of the period of suspension or at any point during that period, the AA/SBDC will either reinstate the cooperative agreement or commence an action for termination or non-renewal.",
            "(ii) The notice of suspension will recommend that the recipient organization cease work on the project immediately. The SBA is under no obligation to reimburse any expenses incurred by a recipient organization while its cooperative agreement is under suspension. Where AA/SBDC decides to lift a suspension and reinstate a recipient organization's cooperative agreement, the Agency may, at its discretion, choose to reimburse a recipient organization for some or all of the expenses it incurred in furtherance of project objectives during the period of suspension. However, there is no guarantee that the Agency will elect to accept such expenses, and recipient organizations incurring expenses while under suspension do so at their own risk.",
            "(b) Cause. The AA/SBDC may terminate, elect not to renew, or suspend a cooperative agreement with a recipient organization for cause. The cause may include, but is not limited to the following:",
            "(1) Non-performance;",
            "(2) Poor performance;",
            "(3) Unwillingness or inability to implement changes to improve performance;",
            "(4) Disregard or material violation of regulations;",
            "(5) Willful or material failure to comply with the terms of the cooperative agreement, including relevant OMB Circulars;",
            "(6) Conduct of the SBDC Lead Center Director or other key personnel, reflecting a lack of business integrity or honesty, which is not properly addressed on the part of the recipient organization or sponsoring SBDC organizations;",
            "(7) A conflict of interest on the part of the recipient organization, the SBDC service centers, the SBDC Lead Center Director, other key personnel, contractors or volunteers that causes a real or perceived detriment to a small business concern, a contractor, the SBDC network, including but not limited to, SBDC service centers, or SBA;",
            "(8) Improper use of Federal funds;",
            "(9) Failure of a Lead Center or its service centers to consent to audits, examinations, certification reviews, or to maintain required documents or records;",
            "(10) Failure to implement recommendations from the audits or examinations within one year of notification of deficiencies;",
            "(11) Failure to implement conditions from accreditation reviews within the time frame recommended by the accreditation committee and established by the AA/SBDC;",
            "(12) Failure of the SBDC Lead Center Director to work at the SBDC Lead Center on a full-time basis;",
            "(13) Failure to promptly suspend or terminate the employment of an SBDC Lead Center Director, Service Center Director, or other key personnel, contractors, or volunteers upon receipt of knowledge or written information by the recipient organization and/or SBA indicating that such individual has engaged in conduct which may result or has resulted in a criminal conviction or civil judgment that would cause the public to question the SBDC's integrity. The SBDC Lead Center Director (or other appropriate official in the SBDC network), when making the decision to suspend or terminate such an employee, must consider the magnitude of the behavior, the repetitiveness of the conduct, and the remoteness in time of the behavior underlying any conviction or judgment;",
            "(14) Failure to maintain adequate client service facilities or service hours; and",
            "(15) Any other action that materially and adversely affects the operation or integrity of an SBDC or the SBDC Program.",
            "(c) Administrative procedure for suspension, termination, and nonrenewal. These procedures apply to termination, non-renewal, and suspension of cooperative agreements with recipient organizations.",
            "(1) Taking action. When the Program Manager has reason to believe that there is cause to suspend, terminate, or non-renew a cooperative agreement with a recipient organization, either based on their own knowledge or upon information provided by other parties, the AA/SBDC may undertake an enforcement action by issuing a written notice of suspension, termination, or non-renewal to the recipient organization. The effects of such notice are addressed in paragraph (a) of this section.",
            "(2) Notice requirements. Each notice of suspension, termination, or non-renewal will set forth the specific facts and reasons for the AA/SBDC's decision and will include reference to the appropriate legal authority. The notice will also advise the recipient organization that it has the right to request an administrative review of the decision to suspend, terminate, or non-renew its cooperative agreement in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph (d) of this section. The notice will be transmitted electronically, via email, to the recipient organization on the same date it is issued by mail.",
            "(3) Relationship to Government-wide suspension and debarment. A decision by the AA/SBDC to suspend, terminate, or not renew an SBDC cooperative agreement does not constitute a non-procurement suspension or debarment of a recipient organization under Executive Order 12549, Debarment and Suspension, and SBA's implementation of OMB regulations at 2 CFR part 2700. However, a decision by the AA/SBDC to undertake a suspension, termination, or non-renewal enforcement action with regard to a particular SBDC cooperative agreement does not preclude or preempt the Agency from also taking action to suspend or debar a recipient organization for purposes of all Federal procurement and/or non-procurement opportunities.",
            "(d) Administrative review of suspension, termination and nonrenewal actions. When the AA/SBDC has suspended, terminated, or elected not to renew a cooperative agreement, the recipient organization has the right to request an administrative review of the enforcement action. Administrative review of the AA/SBDC's enforcement actions will be conducted by the Associate Administrator for Entrepreneurial Development (AA/ED).",
            "(1) Format. There is no prescribed format for a request for an administrative review of an SBA enforcement action. While a recipient organization has the right to retain legal counsel to represent its interests in connection with an administrative review, it is under no obligation to do so. Formal briefs and other technical forms of pleading are not required. However, a request for an administrative review of an SBA enforcement action must be in writing, should be concise and logically arranged, and must at a minimum include the following information:",
            "(i) Name and address of the recipient organization;",
            "(ii) Identification of the relevant SBA office/program (i.e., Office of Small Business Development Centers/Small Business Development Center Program);",
            "(iii) Cooperative agreement number;",
            "(iv) Copy of the notice of suspension, termination, or non-renewal;",
            "(v) Statement discussing why the recipient organization believes the SBA's actions were arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and/or otherwise not in accordance with the law or governing regulations;",
            "(vi) Identification of the specific relief being sought (e.g., lifting of the suspension);",
            "(vii) Statement as to whether the recipient organization is requesting a hearing, and if so, the reasons why it believes a hearing is necessary; and",
            "(viii) Copies of any documents or other evidence the recipient organization believes support its position.",
            "(2) Service. Any recipient organization requesting an administrative review of an SBA enforcement action must submit copies of its request (including any attachments) to:",
            "(i) AA/SBDC; and",
            "(ii) the Associate General Counsel for Procurement Law.",
            "(3) Timeliness. To be considered timely, the AA/ED must receive a request for an administrative review from the recipient organization within 30 days of the date of the notice of termination, non-renewal, or suspension. Any request for administrative review received by the AA/ED more than 30 days after the date of the notice of suspension, termination, or non-renewal will be considered untimely and will be rejected without being considered.",
            "(i) In addition, if the AA/ED does not receive a request for an administrative review within the 30-day deadline, then the decision by the AA/SBDC to suspend, terminate, or non-renew a recipient organization's cooperative agreement will become the final Agency decision on the matter.",
            "(ii) [Reserved]",
            "(4) Standard of review. In order to have the suspension, termination, or non-renewal of a cooperative agreement reversed on an administrative review, a recipient organization must successfully demonstrate that the SBA enforcement action was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and/or otherwise not in accordance with the law or governing regulations.",
            "(5) Conduct of the proceeding. Each party must serve the opposing party with copies of all requests, arguments, evidence, and any other filings it submits pursuant to the administrative review. Within 30 days of the AA/ED receiving a request for an administrative review, the AA/ED must also receive the SBA's arguments and evidence in defense of its decision to suspend, terminate, or non-renew a recipient organization's cooperative agreement. If the SBA fails to provide its arguments and evidence in a timely manner, the administrative review will be conducted solely on the basis of the information provided by the recipient organization. After receiving the SBA's response to the request for an administrative review or after the passage of the 30-day deadline for filing such a response, the AA/ED will take one or more of the following actions, as applicable:",
            "(i) Notify the parties whether the AA/ED has decided to grant a request for a hearing.",
            "(ii) Direct the parties to submit further arguments and/or evidence on any issues, that she/he believes require clarification.",
            "(iii) Notify the parties that the AA/ED has declared the record to be closed and therefore will refuse to admit any further evidence or argument.",
            "(iv) Within ten calendar days of declaring the record to be closed, provide all parties with a copy of the AA/ED's written decision on the merits of the administrative review.",
            "(6) Request for hearing. The AA/ED will only grant a request for a hearing if she/he concludes that there is a genuine dispute as to a material fact that cannot be resolved except by the taking of testimony and the confrontation of witnesses. If the AA/ED grants a request for a hearing, they will set the time and place for the hearing, determine whether the hearing will be conducted in person, via telephone or virtually, and identify which witnesses will be permitted to give testimony.",
            "(7) Evidence. The recipient organization and SBA each have the right to submit whatever evidence they believe is relevant to the matter in dispute. No form of evidence will be permitted unless a party has made a substantial showing, based upon credible evidence and not mere allegation, that the other party has acted in bad faith or engaged in improper behavior.",
            "(8) Decision. The decision of the AA/ED will be effective immediately as of the date it is issued. The decision of the AA/ED will represent the final Agency decision on all matters in dispute on administrative review. No further relief may be sought from or granted by the Agency. If the AA/ED determines that the SBA's decision to suspend, terminate, or non-renew a cooperative agreement was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and/or otherwise not in accordance with the law, she/he will reverse the Agency's enforcement action and direct the SBA to reinstate the recipient organization's cooperative agreement.",
            "(i) Where an enforcement action has been reversed on administrative review, the SBA will have no more than ten calendar days to implement the AA/ED's decision. However, to the extent permitted under the applicable OMB Circulars, the SBA reserves the right to impose such special conditions in the recipient organization's cooperative agreement as it deems necessary to protect the Government's interests.",

A decision to terminate a cooperative agreement is effective immediately as of the date of the notice of termination. A recipient organization may not incur further obligations under the cooperative agreement after the date of termination unless it has been expressly authorized to do so in the notice of termination.",
            "(ii) Funds remaining under the cooperative agreement may be made available by the AA/OWBO to satisfy financial obligations properly incurred by the recipient organization prior to the date of termination. Award funds will not be available for obligations incurred subsequent to the effective date of termination unless expressly authorized under the notice of termination. A recipient organization that has had its cooperative agreement terminated will have 90 days to submit final closeout documents as instructed by the SBA.",
            "(3) Non-renewal. (i) The AA/OWBO may elect not to renew a cooperative agreement with a recipient organization at any point. In undertaking a non-renewal action, the SBA may either decline to accept or consider any application for renewal the organization submits, or the agency may decline to exercise any option years remaining under the cooperative agreement. A recipient organization that has had its cooperative agreement non-renewed may continue to conduct project activities and incur allowable expenses until the end of the current budget period.",
            "(ii) Funds remaining under a non-renewed cooperative agreement may be utilized to satisfy financial obligations the recipient organization properly incurred prior to the end of the budget period. Award funds will not be available for obligations incurred subsequent to the end of the current budget period. A recipient organization that has had its cooperative agreement non-renewed will have until the end of the current budget period or 120 days, whichever is longer, to conclude its operations and submit closeout documents as instructed by the SBA.",
            "(b) Material non-compliance. The AA/OWBO may suspend, terminate, or not renew a cooperative agreement, in whole or in part, with a recipient organization for material non-compliance (frequently referred to as for cause). Material non-compliance may include, but is not limited to, the following:",
            "(1) Non-performance;",
            "(2) Poor performance;",
            "(3) Unwillingness or inability to implement changes to improve performance;",
            "(4) Willful or material failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the cooperative agreement, including relevant Office of Management and Budget circulars;",
            "(5) Conduct reflecting a lack of business integrity or honesty on the part of the recipient organization, the WBC Program Director, or other significant employee(s), which has not been properly addressed;",
            "(6) A conflict of interest on the part of the recipient organization, the WBC Program Director, or other significant employees causing real or perceived detriment to a small business concern, a contractor, the WBC, or the SBA;",
            "(7) Improper management or use of Federal funds;",
            "(8) Failure of a WBC to consent to audits or examinations, or to maintain required documents or records;",
            "(9) Failure to implement recommendations from the audits or examinations within 30 days of their receipt;",
            "(10) Failure of the WBC Program Director to work at the WBC on a 100 percent full-time basis on the WBC project;",
            "(11) Failure to promptly suspend or terminate the employment of a WBC Program Director, or other significant employee, upon receipt of knowledge or written information by the recipient organization and/or the SBA indicating that such individual has engaged in conduct, which may result or has resulted in a criminal conviction or civil judgment which would cause the public to question the WBC's integrity. In making the decision to suspend or terminate such an employee, the recipient organization must consider such factors as the magnitude and repetitiveness of the harm caused and the remoteness in time of the behavior underlying any conviction or judgment;",
            "(12) Failure to maintain adequate client service facilities or service hours;",
            "(13) Fraud, waste, abuse, mismanagement or criminal activity on the part of the recipient organization and/or its staff/employees; or",
            "(14) Any other action that the AA/OWBO believes materially and adversely affects the operation or integrity of a WBC or the WBC program.",
            "(c) Procedures. The same procedures will apply regardless of whether a cooperative agreement with a recipient organization is being suspended, terminated, or non-renewed by the SBA.",
            "(1) Taking action. When the AA/OWBO has reason to believe there is cause to suspend, terminate, or non-renew a cooperative agreement with a recipient organization (either based on its own knowledge or upon information provided to it by other parties), the AA/OWBO may undertake such an enforcement action by issuing a written notice of suspension, termination, or non-renewal to the recipient organization.",
            "(2) Notice requirements. Each notice of suspension, termination, or non-renewal will set forth the specific facts and reasons for the AA/OWBO decision and will include reference to the appropriate legal authority. The notice will also advise the recipient organization that it has the right to request an administrative review of the decision to suspend, terminate, or non-renew its cooperative agreement in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph (d) of this section. The notice will be transmitted to the recipient organization on the same date it is issued by both U.S. Mail and facsimile or as an email attachment.",
            "(3) Relationship to government-wide suspension and debarment. A decision by the AA/OWBO to suspend, terminate, or non-renew a WBC cooperative agreement does not constitute a nonprocurement suspension or debarment of a recipient organization under Executive Order 12549 and SBA's implementing regulations (2 CFR part 2700). However, a decision by the AA/OWBO to undertake a suspension, termination, or non-renewal enforcement action with regard to a particular WBC cooperative agreement does not preclude or preempt the Agency from also taking action to suspend or debar a recipient organization for purposes of all Federal procurement and/or nonprocurement opportunities.",
            "(d) Administrative review. Any recipient organization that has had its cooperative agreement suspended, terminated, or non-renewed has the right to request an administrative review of the AA/OWBO's enforcement action. Administrative review of WBC enforcement actions will be conducted by the AA/OED.",
            "(1) Format. There is no prescribed format for a request for administrative review of an SBA enforcement action. While a recipient organization has the right to retain legal counsel to represent its interests in connection with an administrative review, it is under no obligation to do so. Formal briefs and other technical forms of pleading are not required. However, a request for administrative review of an SBA enforcement action must be in writing, should be concise and logically arranged, and must at a minimum include the following information:",
            "(i) Name and address of the recipient organization;",
            "(ii) Identification of the relevant SBA office/program (i.e., OWBO/WBC Program);",
            "(iii) Cooperative agreement number;",
            "(iv) Copy of the notice of suspension, termination, or non-renewal;",
            "(v) Statement regarding why the recipient organization believes the SBA's actions were arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and/or otherwise not in accordance with the law;",
            "(vi) Identification of the specific relief being sought (e.g., lifting of the suspension);",
            "(vii) Statement as to whether the recipient organization is requesting a hearing and, if so, the reasons why it believes a hearing is necessary; and",
            "(viii) Copies of any documents or other evidence the recipient organization believes support its position.",
            "(2) Service. Any recipient organization requesting administrative review of an SBA enforcement action must submit copies of its request (including any attachments) to all of the following parties:",
            "(i) Associate Administrator for the Office of Entrepreneurial Development, U.S. Small Business Administration;",
            "(ii) Assistant Administrator for the Office of Women's Business Ownership U.S. Small Business Administration;",
            "(iii) Associate General Counsel for Procurement Law, U.S. Small Business Administration.",
            "(e) Timeliness. (i) In order to be considered timely, the AA/OED must receive a recipient organization's request for administrative review within 30 days of the date of the notice of suspension, termination, or non-renewal. Any request for administrative review received by the AA/OED more than 30 days after the date of the notice of suspension, termination, or non-renewal will be considered untimely and will automatically be rejected without being considered.",
            "(ii) In addition, if the AA/OED does not receive a request for administrative review within the 30-day deadline, then the decision by the AA/OWBO to suspend, terminate, or non-renew a recipient organization's cooperative agreement will automatically become the final Agency decision on the matter.",
            "(f) Standard of review. In order to have the suspension, termination, or non-renewal of a cooperative agreement reversed on administrative review, a recipient organization must successfully demonstrate that the SBA enforcement action was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and/or otherwise not in accordance with the law.",
            "(g) Conduct of the proceeding. (1) Each party must serve the opposing party with copies of all requests, arguments, evidence, and any other filings it submits pursuant to the administrative review. Within 30 days of the AA/OED receiving a request for administrative review, the AA/OED must also receive the SBA's arguments and evidence in defense of its decision to suspend, terminate, or non-renew a recipient organization's cooperative agreement. If the SBA fails to provide its arguments and evidence in a timely manner, the administrative review will be conducted solely on the basis of the information provided by the recipient organization.",
            "(2) After receiving the SBA's response to the request for administrative review or the passage of the 30-day deadline for filing such a response, the AA/OED will take one or more of the following actions, as applicable:",
            "(i) Notify the parties whether she/he has decided to grant a request for a hearing;",
            "(ii) Direct the parties to submit further arguments and/or evidence on any issues which she/he believes require clarification; and/or",
            "(iii) Notify the parties that she/he has declared the record to be closed and therefore she/he will refuse to admit any further evidence or argument.",
            "(3) The AA/OED will only grant a request for a hearing if she/he concludes that there is a genuine dispute as to a material fact that cannot be resolved except by the taking of testimony and the confrontation of witnesses. If the AA/OED grants a request for a hearing, she/he will set the time and place for the hearing, determine whether the hearing will be conducted in person or via telephone, and identify which witnesses will be permitted to give testimony.",
            "(4) Within 10 calendar days of declaring the record to be closed, the AA/OED will provide all parties with a copy of her/his written decision on the merits of the administrative review.",
            "(h) Evidence. The recipient organization and the SBA each have the right to submit whatever evidence they believe is relevant to the matter in dispute. No form of discovery will be permitted unless a party has made a substantial showing, based upon credible evidence and not mere allegation that the other party has acted in bad faith or engaged in improper behavior.",
            "(i) Decision. (1) The decision of the AA/OED will be effective immediately as of the date it is issued. The decision of the AA/OED will represent the final Agency decision on all matters in dispute on administrative review. No further relief may be sought from or granted by the Agency. If the AA/OED determines that the SBA's decision to suspend, terminate, or non-renew a cooperative agreement was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and/or otherwise not in accordance with the law, she/he will reverse the Agency's enforcement action and direct the SBA to reinstate the recipient organization's cooperative agreement.",
            "(2) Where an enforcement action has been reversed on administrative review, the SBA will have no more than 10 calendar days to implement the AA/OED's decision. However, to the extent permitted under the applicable Office of Management and Budget circulars, the SBA reserves the right to impose such special conditions in the recipient organization's cooperative agreement as it deems necessary to protect the government's interests."

            "(2) The appeal petition must be received by the Committee within 30 calendar days of the date of SBA's decision. A copy of the appeal petition must also be provided to the AA/OWBO.",
            "(3) There is no prescribed format for the submission of an appeal petition. Formal briefs and other technical forms of pleading are not required, nor is the grantee required to obtain civil representation. However, the appeal petition must be in writing and must be concise, factual, and logically arranged. In addition, the appeal petition must contain the following:",

Within 60 calendar days of receiving the appeal petition, the Committee will present its decision in writing to the recipient organization and the AA/OWBO. The Committee's ruling will represent the final Agency decision on the subject of the dispute and will not be further appealable within SBA.",
            "(5) Requests for an appeal before the Committee will not be granted unless the Agency determines there are substantial material facts in dispute.",
            "(6) The Committee may request additional information or documentation from the recipient organization at any stage in the proceedings. The recipient organization's response to the Committee's request for additional information or documentation must be submitted, in writing, to the Committee within 15 calendar days of receipt of the request. In the event that the recipient organization fails to follow the procedures specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the Committee may dismiss the appeal by a written order.",
            "(7) If a request for an appeal is granted, the Committee will provide the recipient organization with written instructions and will afford the parties an opportunity to present their positions to the Committee in writing.",
            "(8) The chairperson of the Committee, with advice from the SBA's Office of General Counsel, will issue a final written decision within 30 calendar days of receipt of all information or inform the recipient organization that additional time to issue a decision is necessary. A copy of the decision will be transmitted to the recipient organization, with copies to the AA/OWBO.",
            "(9) At any time within 120 days of the end of the budget period, the recipient organization may submit a written request to use an expedited dispute appeal process. The Committee, by an affirmative vote of a majority of its total membership, may expedite the appeals process to attain final resolution of a dispute before the issuance date of a new cooperative agreement.",
