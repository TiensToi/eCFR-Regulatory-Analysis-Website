# eCFR Regulatory Analysis Project Submission Notes

## Project Requirements Checklist

**1. Download and Store eCFR Data**
- Automated scripts download the latest eCFR XML files for all titles.
- Data is stored server-side (on your laptop) in the `data/raw` directory.

**2. Parse and Analyze Data**
- Parsing scripts convert XML to JSON for each title.
- Metrics computed: word count, readability, checksum (per title and per part/section).
- Historical metrics and citation counts are tracked.
- A custom metric (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid readability) is included to inform decision-making.

**3. API and UI**
- Streamlit dashboard provides a user interface for analysis.
- Users can select titles, view metrics, and download results.
- Metrics table, part/section analysis, citation counts, network graph, and historical trends are available.
- All results are reviewable in the UI.

**4. Code Quality**
- Code is modular, documented, and robust to missing data.
- All features are working as described.
